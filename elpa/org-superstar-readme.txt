 Prettify headings and plain lists in org-mode.  This package is a
 direct descendant of ‘org-bullets’, with most of the code base
 completely rewritten (See https://github.com/sabof/org-bullets).
 Currently, this package supports:

* Prettifying org heading lines by:
  + replacing trailing bullets by UTF-8 bullets
  + hiding leading stars, customizing their look or removing them
    from vision
  + applying a custom face to the header bullet
  + applying a custom face to the leading bullets
  + using double-bullets for inline tasks (see org-inlinetask.el)
  + (optional) using special bullets for TODO keywords
* Prettifying org plain list bullets by:
  + replacing each bullet type (*, + and -) with UTF-8 bullets
  + applying a custom face to item bullets
* Gracefully degrading features when viewed from terminal

This package is heavily influenced by (and uses snippets from) the
popular package "org-bullets", created by sabof.  It was made with
the goal of inheriting features the author liked about org-bullets
while being able to introduce compatibility-breaking changes to it.
It is largely rewritten, to the point of almost no function being
identical to it's org-bullets counterpart.

This package is versioned using (the author's understanding of)
semantic versioning: "<major>.<minor>.<patch>".
<major> version increments signify backward incompatible changes.
<minor> version increments signify backward compatible but
        significant changes.
<patch> version increments signify changes not affecting the API.

Here are some Unicode blocks which are generally nifty resources
