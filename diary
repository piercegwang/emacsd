DIARY -*- mode: org -*-

* Sep 22, 2018
I had no idea this existed! This is my first diary entry on emacs. I just discovered this (emacs) yesterday. This has gone above and beyond my expectations! I'm hoping to use emacs to take care of at least to-do lists in the future. The rest of tonight will be spent on learning about emacs as well as working on my FRQ2 for tomorrow.

Today I discovered that OneNote (A note taking system I was perfectly happy with before) has a pivotal flaw that (because of privacy and organizational concerns) cannot, simply, be ignored. That flaw is that the data held in the OneNote is not at all controllable. While there seems to still be a way to export OneNote files on windows (which I will have to try sometime soon), there is no good way to export files through Mac's version of OneNote. In addition, Microsoft forces you to hold your OneNote files in the cloud. There is absolutely no way to save them locally. This is a huge problem as this forces you to use the cloud as well. Thus, I am going to have to switch to some otehr note taking system. I am currently considering simple markdown text (org-mode). However, I may also use something such as CherryTree. Another possibility is just that I stick with onenote and deal with *it*.

(Past Midnight) 1:30
I'm going to be writing this moreor less with my eyes closed (glasses off... essentially the same thing). Fair warning:
Today was quite an interesting day. It was a moderately normal Saturday. However, I ended up staying longer for Josie's performance in the kick-off concert and also to hangout with Charlotte. Despite now being comfortable saying "I love you" in chat, I have not yet gathered up the courage nor have I found the right moment to say "I love you" in person. We got along very well as usual and from taht standpoint everything went well. My (second) performance with the Solano Symphony is coming up and will be happening this Oct 6-7. I'm looking forward to it. however, I am also mildyly worried about myself being unprepared. However, I really just need to work on intonation and my encore piece (Paganini Caprice No.4). In emacs, I've learned many new things and have been keeping quite good manuals of everything In addition I've learned more about how asymmetric ciphers work and now understand how to use GnuPG encryption. Anyways, I stayed up late finishing my homework (Lab 2, OB010) and thus will either sleep in tomorrow or be really *really* tired. In any case I should probably go to bed now. Good night!

Dream Journal: I had a dream about Charlotte last night... we (Josie, Ryan, Charlotte, and I) were all hanging out at the conservatory, and Josie suggested we go out, but she really meant that Charlotte and I go outside to spend some time together. We found a nice place to sit and we held hands for the first time. After that we kept holding hands even after Ryan and Josie came to sit. Then Josie came and sat between us to ask me a question about school and then I realized I missed my class!

Added orgmode to the diary! So, today I was working on my HSC presentation on paradoxes up until 12:30 am. It is now 12:42 am (or... 0:42) and I am brushing my teeth. I am hoping to give a good presentation tomorrow!
