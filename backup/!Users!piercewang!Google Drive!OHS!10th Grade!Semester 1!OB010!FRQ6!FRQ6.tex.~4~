\textbf{Question 1:} In the past, mutations (changes in the DNA sequence) were
thought to occur randomly. However, several investigators have
hypothesized that environmental stress can induce mechanisms that
\emph{increase} the rate of mutation! One such mechanism in \emph{E. coli}
involves switching from a nearly error-free DNA polymerase to an
error-prone DNA polymerase.

\begin{enumerate}
\item (10 points) Describe the “normal” way in which DNA polymerase can
proofread DNA, and briefly describe at least two other DNA repair
mechanisms

\begin{enumerate}
\item Normally, in the lagging strand, DNA would be checked and
proofread by the DNA polymerase after the RNA primer has filled in
what it can with the corresponding RNA. In the leading strand, the
DNA polymerase works to fill in the corresponding nucleotides and
proofreads at the same time. Because of this, it does a very good
job of checking its own work. DNA polymerase synthesizes the DNA
molecules and proofreads the DNA, working off of a template to
make sure that the DNA is correct.
\end{enumerate}

\item (10 points) In contrast, speculate how the process that you described
in part a might differ with an error-prone DNA polymerase. How might
this result in a beneficial outcome for the bacteria? (Consider that
mutations are commonly deleterious, but may be beneficial; consider
also the typical mode of bacterial reproduction = binary fission)

\begin{enumerate}
\item Normally, variation comes through the different genes communicated
in chromosomes through DNA replication. However, in an error-prone
DNA polymerase, more mutations would commonly happen and would
thus cause much variation in the offspring. In the case of
bacteria, because bacteria normally has no other method of
introducing variation into the population, having error-prone DNA
polymerase would be quite beneficial as it would allow the
bacteria to still undergo natural selection and thus adapt to the
environment.
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Question 2:} Eukaryotic chromosomes have special nucleotide sequences
called telomeres at their ends. These non-coding regions, which are
repeats of TTAGGG on one strand and AATCCC on the other, have been
compared to the plastic or metal-covered ends of shoelaces (word nerds:
those are aglets!). Their disappearance during replication cycles has
been related to aging.

\begin{enumerate}
\item (5 points) Briefly describe what happens during replication of the
ends of linear chromosomes, and how this shortening can occur.
Consider the leading and lagging strands, and the DNA sequence
occupied by the primer.

\begin{enumerate}
\item During the replication of the ends of linear chromosomes, the
lagging strand loses fragment of DNA because there is no 3' end
available for DNA polymerase to connect to. Thus, the RNA primer
is lost. While the leading strand does have that part, it is lost
because the second round of replication needs both strands. This
process leads to progressively shorter daughter molecules.
\end{enumerate}

\item (5 points) Why might the shortening of telomeres be related to aging?
You may also argue that they are unrelated but be sure to support
your argument with at least one piece of evidence.

\begin{enumerate}
\item The shortening of telomeres would very much be related to aging
because as a person gets older, their cells never perfectly
regenerate. Thus, every time a cell divides, it loses some genetic
information and thus deteriorates. At some point, our cells don't
have enough genetic material to make a cohesive human, and we die
of old age.
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Question 3:} (5 points) Sunflowers with flowers 10 cm in diameter are
crossed with sunflowers with 20 cm flowers. The F1 plants have flowers
that are 15 cm in diameter. In the F2 generation, 4 flowers are 10 cm in
diameter, 4 are 20 cm in diameter, and there are 5 phenotypic classes
with diameters intermediate to the extremes.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Assuming that the alleles that contribute to flower diameter act
additively, how many genes control flower size in this strain of
sunflowers?

\begin{enumerate}
\item 3 genes encoding for the diameter
\end{enumerate}

\item How much does each additive allele contribute to flower diameter?

\begin{enumerate}
\item Each allele adds 5/3 cm to the diameter.
\end{enumerate}

\item If there are 256 flowers, how many would you expect in each size
class?
\end{enumerate}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lr}
\hline
10 cm & 1\\
11 + 2/3 cm & 24\\
13 + 1/3 cm & 60\\
15 cm & 86\\
16 + 2/3 cm & 60\\
18 + 1/3 cm & 24\\
20 cm & 1\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\textbf{Question 4:} (5 points) Assume that humanlike creatures exist on Mars.
As in the human population on Earth, there are two sexes and even
sex-linked genes. The gene for eye color is an example of one such gene.
It has two alleles. The purple allele is dominant to the yellow allele.
A purple-eyed female alien mates with a purple-eyed male. All of the
male offspring are purple-eyed, while half the female offspring are
purple-eyed, and half are yellow-eyed. Which is the heterogametic sex?
Draw out the two options of the Punnett squares in support of your
explanation.

First assuming the male sex is the heterogametic sex:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline
 & X$\backslash$\(^{\text{P}}\) & Y\\
\hline
X$\backslash$\(^{\text{P}}\) & X$\backslash$\(^{\text{P}}\) X$\backslash$\(^{\text{P}}\) & X$\backslash$\(^{\text{P}}\) Y\\
X$\backslash$\(^{\text{p}}\) & X$\backslash$\(^{\text{P}}\) X$\backslash$\(^{\text{p}}\) & X$\backslash$\(^{\text{p}}\) Y\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

This would show half the males to have purple eyes and half to have
yellow eyes. However, this is not the case and the following table
explain the observed phenomena much better.

Assuming the female sex is the heterogametic sex:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline
 &  & Female\\
\hline
 & X\(^{\text{P}}\) & Y\\
X\(^{\text{P}}\) & X\(^{\text{P}}\) X\(^{\text{P}}\) & X\(^{\text{P}}\) Y\\
X\(^{\text{p}}\) & X\(^{\text{P}}\) X\(^{\text{p}}\) & X\(^{\text{p}}\) Y\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\textbf{Question 5:} (5 points) Males have only one X chromosome, and therefore
only one copy of all genes on the X chromosome (except for the few that
are homologous on the Y). Females have two X chromosomes, but one is
always inactivated. Therefore, females, like males, have only one
functional copy of all of the genes on the X chromosome. Why are females
not considered hemizygous, and why are they not afflicted with sex-lined
recessive diseases as often as males are? \\

Because females have two X chromosomes, the dominant trait between the X
chromosomes always wins out. Thus, the sex-lined recessive diseases only
come about when there are two copies of the recessive gene. This in turn
is seen to be much less common just by looking at a punnet square like
the one in question 4. Assuming the male is the heterogametic sex, then
the male has a ½ chance of expressing the recessive gene. In contrast,
the female would at worst only be a carrier for the gene to the next
generation. \\

\textbf{Question 6:} (5 points) A wild-type fruit fly (heterozygous for gray
body color and normal wings) is crossed with a black fly with vestigial
wings (both mutant recessive phenotypes). The offspring have the
following phenotypic distribution: wildtype: 778; black body vestigial:
785; black body normal wing: 158; grey body vestigial wing: 162. What is
the recombination frequency between the genes for body color and wing
size? If there is 9\% recombination between the genes for body color and
red vs. cinnabar eye color, how do you expect the genes for body color,
eye color, and wing size to be arranged on the chromosome? Is there just
one option? \\

Recombination frequency calculation: \\

\(\dfrac{158+162}{778+785+158+162} = ~0.16994 \\\)
\(0.16994 \cdot 100 = ~17% \\\)


If there were a 9\% recombination between the genes for body color and
red vs cinnabar eye color, I would expect the genes to be quite close on
the chromosome. In addition, the cinnabar eye color would probably be
right in the middle between the two genes for black and gray. They could
be placed anywhere between the two genes. However, if they were to be on
either side, then it would be impossible to have at least one combination
of cinnabar eyes and another body color type. Thus, the only possible
combination would be for the cinnabar gene to be in the middle somewhere
between the other two genes.
