Dear Maestro Lohss,

I really appreciate your giving me the opportunity to perform again with you and really enjoyed these past two performances. Please extend my appreciation to all the orchestra members especially Mr. Baluyev. I look forward to our future collaborations! Thanks again!

Warm regards,
Pierce
