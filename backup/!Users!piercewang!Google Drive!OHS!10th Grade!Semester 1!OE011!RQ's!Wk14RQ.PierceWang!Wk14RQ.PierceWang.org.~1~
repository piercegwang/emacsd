3. In your portfolio, you’ll write a 2-3-page essay about one of the parables from our reading, either from Text Book or those posted to Canvas, paying special attention to how it works as a metaphorical system. Choose one of our parables, and get started, with some combination of these questions (or others that come to mind): what’s interesting about it? What questions does it call to mind? How does it work metaphorically? What are the implications of choosing that/those vehicle(s) for that/those tenor(s)? What does it demand of the reader?
