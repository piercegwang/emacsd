\section{Lab Overview}
\label{sec:orge2de038}
\subsection{Introduction}
\label{sec:org2ba2850}

In this lab, you get to be Gregor Mendel for a week. Instead of pea plants, you will be studying Wisconsin Fast Plants™ (\url{http://www.fastplants.org}). These plants were bred at the University of Wisconsin, Madison to have a remarkably fast life cycle. As you will see, these plants sprout within 24-48 hours. 

Just as Gregor Mendel did, you will score multiple phenotypes for two traits in combination in several generations. The characteristics that you will follow are stem color and leaf color. The stems will be purple or not purple, and leaves will be dark green or yellow-green. You will observe the sprouts from Fast Plant seeds and count the number of each combination of phenotypes: the number of sprouts with purple stem and green leaves, purple stem and yellow-green leaves, non-purple stem and green leaves, and non-purple stem and yellow-green leaves. You will observe both parental varieties (P1 and P2), the offspring of a cross between P1 and P2 plants (F1), and the offspring of a self-cross of F1 plants (F2).

Please contact Dr. Vetter (kmead@stanford.edu or ksmvetter@gmail.com) if you have any questions or concerns, and good luck!

\subsection{Before You Begin}
\label{sec:org399d0f5}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Remember} to read the entire protocol before you start. Do you understand it? Are you ready?
\item \textbf{Gather} all necessary materials. Make sure all materials are ready to use. You don’t want to be missing anything right when you need it!
\item \textbf{Set up} your light source. You can use natural light if you are somewhere really sunny, but otherwise the light will need to be on 24 hours a day for seven days, so choose the location wisely. The optimal distance between the petri dishes and the lamp is 8-10cm.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Materials}
\label{sec:orgc46993e}

\begin{itemize}
\item[{$\boxtimes$}] Packets of Wisconsin Fast Plant seeds (1 each of P1, P2, F1, and F2)
\item[{$\boxtimes$}] Petri dishes (4)
\item[{$\boxtimes$}] Sealable plastic bags (4)
\item[{$\boxtimes$}] Filter paper
\item[{$\square$}] Water
\item[{$\boxtimes$}] Scissors
\item[{$\square$}] Lamp (fluorescent is best)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Protocol}
\label{sec:orgc41007a}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Label the bottom of the petri dishes for each of the seed types (P1, P2, F1, and F2).
\item Cut a piece of filter paper to fit in the bottom of each petri dish. Add just enough water to fully moisten the filter paper without making puddles (I added 15 mL, swished, and poured out the excess).
\item Evenly distribute the seeds from each packet into the appropriate petri dish.
\item Replace the lid and place in a sealable plastic bag. Place each under the fluorescent lamp \textasciitilde{}8-10 cm.
\item Observe the seeds and sprouts every day for seven days, noting the combination of stem and leaf colors and ensuring that the filter paper remains moist. It is strongly recommended that you collect data every day as soon as it is possible rather than waiting until the end of the week. Mold and drying out and other things happen. \textbf{Make sure that you keep track of all four possible phenotypes in each petri dish separately.} In other words, for each of P1, P2, F1, and F2, you have to keep track of: (purple stem and dark green leaf)(purple stem and light green leaf)(non-purple stem and dark green leaf)(non-purple stem and light green leaf). Do this every day (and this will incidently also provide you with a measure of how repeatable your measurements are).
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Tips for performing this lab}
\label{sec:org8f8716e}

\begin{itemize}
\item The packets of seeds contain a variable number of seeds. Just use all of them that you have.
\item The filter paper doesn’t come in a handy size. I cut them to the proper size by tracing the bottom of the petri dish on one filter paper, stacking it with three others (so that there are four sheets of paper in a stack), and then cutting inside the line I traced.
\item A good method for properly wetting the filter paper is to use a plastic pipette. If you can dump excess water out of the petri dish, you’ve used too much. (Just dump out the excess, and you’re good to go.)
\item The protocol is fairly straightforward! About 95\% of seeds usually sprout, so don’t be surprised if one or two don’t start growing. You should see growth within 48 hours.
\item The phenotypes may be difficult to score. I recommend looking over the plants and mentally deciding what is green and what is yellow-green in both the purple and non-purple plants, and then going back and scoring more carefully. Note that it will be more difficult to determine leaf color in the purple-stemmed plants. I found the color to be best on the inner surface of the leaves.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Clean-up}
\label{sec:org9c23964}

\begin{itemize}
\item All plastic ware can be thoroughly washed and reused. The filter paper and seeds can go in the trash. Be sure to leave your “lab bench” cleaner than when you found it. (Your parents will appreciate that.)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Lab Report (slightly modified point values)}
\label{sec:org13ea95a}
\begin{itemize}
\item Cover sheet and title (5 points)
\item Introduction (20 points): Provide an introduction to Mendelian genetics particularly the laws of inheritance. Be sure to include a discussion of dominant/recessive alleles, heterozygous/homozygous alleles, phenotype/genotype, dihybrid crosses and the laws of segregation and independent assortment.
\item Materials and methods (5 points)
\item Results (25 points): Present your daily results and observations. A table is ideal for this purpose, but make sure to include summary comments in text form. For your hypothesis, consider your overall observations of P1 and P2, and form hypotheses for what you would expect for F1 and F2, given ideal conditions. Note: P1, P2, and F1 should be uniform, but the traits do not have 100\% penetration, so you may well get outliers, especially if the light conditions are poor. Use the majority pattern in P1, P2, and F1 to make your predictions. You should get a mix of phenotypes in F2. You do not need to provide variables or controls. Note your comfort/accuracy in scoring the two traits. Make sure that you provide pictures of your seedlings, and that you record your data in a table and in the text.
\item Discussion (20 points):  To what extent do your data match your predictions? If not, what could you do to be more certain? What experimental errors (i.e. something you did) might influence your results?
\item References  (5 points): As usual
\item Post-lab Questions (20 points): Answer the questions posed below.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Post-Lab Questions}
\label{sec:orgde49aea}

\begin{itemize}
\item How do your results exemplify Mendel’s Law of Segregation and the Law of Independent Assortment? If you have already addressed this in your discussion, you may refer to the specific page and paragraph as your answer.
\item Perform a Chi-squared analysis on your data, and determine if your data support your hypothesis for F2. Remember, the formula for Chi-squared and the degrees of freedom are on the formula sheet!

\begin{itemize}
\item Top of petri dishes contained more water than expected, so I took them out, wiped them clear, then made sure to keep the filter papers moist with 5 drops of water each (except for P2)
\item Noticed many seeds have germinated however none are identifiable in terms of traits
\end{itemize}
\item \textit{[2018-11-05 Mon 19:03]}
\begin{itemize}
\item Plant are noticably sprouting
\item At this point it is still hard to tell the colors of the stems and leaves. However, they are almost all growing (one small plant that may not make it in F2)
\item Will add more water appropriately
\item Noticed that the water tends to evaporate and stick to the sides of the petri dish. So, instead of adding more water, for some of them I just ran the pipette around the edge to get the water to move down to the filter paper and wet it again. This worked very well and I'll most likely do this from now on
\end{itemize}
\item \textit{[2018-11-07 Wed 17:58]}

\item After doing another day of observations, it seems that the plants have grown a lot. However, my observations have not always been correct. I haven't changed any of the previous ones, but I hope that they will be as accurate as possible

\section{Lab Write-Up}
\label{sec:orgde8a523}
\subsection{Cover sheet and title}
\label{sec:orgf6791b6}
\subsection{Introduction}
\label{sec:org4fc8ad0}
Genetics is a defining factor in how traits are passed down from generation to generation in all living organisms. A defining character in the field of genetics is Gregor Mendel who, through the breeding of pea plants, came up with the basis of all genetic research thereafter. Mendelian genetics works by having certain alleles that pass down the traits from generation to generation. These alleles describe the genes that the organism displays, phenotypes. The phenotypes are determined by the alleles through dominant and recessive alleles, the difference commonly shown as a capital letter vs the lowercase respectively. The organism commonly has two of these alleles which determine the phenotype. The two alleles could be either dominant or recessive. If both dominant, the organism is described as homozygous dominant as it has both dominant alleles. This is similar with both recessive as it is shown to be homozygous recessive. If the organism has a mix of dominant and recessive alleles, then it is said to be heterozygous. The following is an example of a punnet square with one trait where both parents are heterozygous.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|ll|}
\hline
 & A & a\\
\hline
A & AA & Aa\\
a & aA & aa\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Mendel also defined the law of segregation. The law of segregation was defined by mendel as the process during gameete formation in which a memnber of the allelic pair seperates from the other member to form the next gamete. When dealing with more than two traits, one can use a combination of punnet squares to create a table which represents a situation in which two more or traits are involved. In a situation with two traits, the table would represent a dihybrid cross. The following is an example of a punnet square with two traits: Aa and Bb where the one parent has AABb and the other is heterozygous for both traits (AaBb).

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|llll|}
\hline
 & AB & Ab & AB & Ab\\
\hline
AB & AABB & AAbB & AABB & AAbB\\
Ab & AaBb & AAbb & AABb & AAbb\\
aB & AaBB & AabB & AaBB & AabB\\
ab & AaBb & Aabb & AaBb & Aabb\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}


At this point, Mendel defined the law of independent assortment which states that the individual traits of an organism do not affect each other. 
\subsection{Materials and methods}
\label{sec:org7355e60}
The experiments testing the validity of Mendelian genetics were achieved by using the materials and methods described in the \emph{Stanford OHS AP Biology Genetics Lab} protocol and began by preparing 4 petri dishes with a dampened filter paper. This filter paper was cut to the appropriate size for the petri dish and then wet with 15 drops of tap water from a pipette. Seeds were placed in appropriately labeled petri dishes and were then placed in 4 seperate plastic bags and under a flourescent light which was on at all times where they were observed over a 7 day period.
In order to view the difference in traits between the P1, P2, F1, and F2 generations (P1 and P2 being the parents, F1 being P1 and P2's offspring, and F2 the offspring of F1 self-fertalizing), the plants were observed and categorized by traits. The results were put into tables shown in results.
\subsection{Results}
\label{sec:orgd39f0d4}
In order to observe Mendelian genetics in action over three generations, four petri dishes were set up to show the generation's different traits. The final results are shown in the table below and are presented according to the following legend:
\begin{enumerate}
\item purple stem and dark green leaf
\item purple stem and light green leaf
\item non-purple stem and dark green leaf
\item non-purple stem and light green leaf
\item Unidentifiable (Unsprouted)
\end{enumerate}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|r|r|r|r|r|}
\hline
 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5\\
\hline
P1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 11 & 0\\
P2 & 8 & 3 & 0 & 1 & 0\\
F1 & 9 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
F2 & 22 & 1 & 0 & 6 & 3\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
As seen from this table, the P1, P2, and F1 generations were quite uniform in terms of phenotype. My hypothesis, formed assuming that P1 and P2 were completely uniform, was that the P1 generation and P2 generations were homozygous dominant and recessive respectively. Thus, I would predict that the F1 generation would be completely heterozygous. Thus, the F2 generation is easily predicted using a punnet square:
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=.9\linewidth]{./data/punnetsquare.png}
\end{center}
The color in the above table corresponds to the phenotype that is expressed. P represents the color of the stem, and G represents the color of the leaf. My hypothesis was also that the dominant allele for P would represent a purple stem and the dominant G would represent a dark green leaf.

The plants that were tested started sprouting within three days. The following is a picture of the F2 generation on the third day of testing.
