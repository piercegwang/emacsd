\section{Listening 3/C. Open the exercise on the webapp, listen to the  audio file, then answer these questions in English based on the speaker’s message to her dog-sitter.}
\label{sec:org3473602}
\begin{itemize}
\item Does the speaker already know the dog-sitter? How do you know?
\begin{itemize}
\item One could speculate both ways, so it's really hard to tell. If I had to choose, I would say the speaker knows the dog-sitter as they are going to get coffee when the speaker gets back from her trip.
\end{itemize}
\item What specific instructions does the speaker give to the dog-sitter? List them in detail.
\begin{itemize}
\item The dog wakes up at 6am
\item if it's not raining, walk the dog at the park for half an hour
\item if it's raining, then the dog can watch tv at home for half an hour
\item then give him some breakfast to eat, some water to drink
\begin{itemize}
\item don't forget he can only drink water
\item He can't drink even a bit of other drinks
\end{itemize}
\item if he's hungry at noon, give him some fruit to eat
\end{itemize}
\item If you were the dog-sitter, would you have any questions for the owner? Ask at least one.
\begin{itemize}
\item What do I give 小白 for dinner?
\end{itemize}
\item Has the dog-sitter ever met the dog? How do you know?
\begin{itemize}
\item No, because otherwise the owner would already know if the dog-sitter likes 小白 or not.
\end{itemize}
\item Would you dog-sit for the speaker if you were asked? Why or why not?
\begin{itemize}
\item No, because letting a dog watch TV is not at all healthy!
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Reading 5/E. Read this passage, then answer the questions in English. (Interpretive)}
\label{sec:org4787b9d}

这是我的狗，他的毛 (máo) (hair, fur) 是白色的，我叫他小白。因为我属狗，所以我爸爸妈妈送小白给我做生日礼物。他长得很可爱，脸大大的，嘴小小的，鼻子不高。我常常带他到公园去玩。他跟我一样，也喜欢吃肉、喝饮料、不喜欢运动，每天晚上也睡九个钟头的觉。你看，这是小白的照片，他正在笑呢！

\begin{itemize}
\item What is the dog’s name? Who gave him that name, and why?
\begin{itemize}
\item The dog's name is 小白. He was given that name because he's white.
\end{itemize}
\item What are four things that we know about the dog's appearance ?
\begin{itemize}
\item He's grown very cute. His face is big, mouth is very small, and his nose not very big.
\end{itemize}
\item Why did the narrator’s parents give her a dog as a birthday gift?
\begin{itemize}
\item Because the narrator is born of the dog.
\end{itemize}
\item What does the passage tell you about the narrator?
\begin{itemize}
\item The narrator likes eating meat, like drinking (hopefully juice), doesn't like exercising, and sleeps 9 hours a night, and is very much a dog person.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
