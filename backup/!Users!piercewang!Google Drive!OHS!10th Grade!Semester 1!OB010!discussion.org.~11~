* Week 1
** RN Chapter 1 - 1.1-1.2
*** Some properties of life:
   - Order
   - Evolutionary adaptation
   - Regulation
   - Reproduction
   - Response to environment
   - Growth and development
   - Energy processing

*** Five underlying things to focus on in Biology:
   - Organization
   - Information
   - Energy and Matter
   - Interactions
   - Evolution

*** Exploring Levels of Biological Organization
   1. The biosphere - consists of all life on earth and all the places where life exists.
   2. Ecosystems - consists of all the living things in a particular area, along with all nonliving components of the environment with which life interacts, such as soil, water, atmospheric gases, and light
   3. Communities - array of organisms inhabiting a particular ecosystem
   4. Populations - consists of all the individuals of a species living within the bounds of a specified area
   5. Organisms - individual living things
   6. Organs - a body part that is made up of multiple tissues and has specific functions in the body (leaves, stems, and roots of plants)
   7. Tissues - a group of cells that work together, performing a specialized function
   8. Cells - life's fundamental unit of structure and function
   9. Organelles - various functional components present in cells
   10. Molecules - a chemical structure consisting of two or more units called atoms

*** Some definitions:
   - Emergent properties - novel properties that emerge at each level that are absent from the preceding one
     - Not unique to life (e.g. bicycles)
     - To study, biologists complement reductionism with systems biology
   - Systems biology - the exploration of a biological system by analyzing the interactions among its parts
   - At each level of biological hierarchy, there is a correlation of structure and function
     - Leaves being shaped such that they have the maximum surface area and can thus absorb the most sunlight
*** The Cell: An organism's Basic Unit of Structure and Function
   - In the structural hierarchy, cell is the smallest unit of organization that can perform all activities required for life
   - Prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells
     - Single celled microorganisms
     - Bacteria (singular, bacterium) and archaea (singular, archaean) are prokaryotic
     - All other forms of life are composed of eukaryotic cells
   - Eukaryotic cell contains membrane-enclosed organelles. 
   - Prokaryotic cells lack nuclei or other membrane-enclosed organelles
   - Prokaryotic cells are generally smaller than eukaryotic cells.

*** Theme: Life's Processes Involve the Expression and Transmission of Genetic Information
   - In cells, chromosomes contain genetic material in DNA (DeoxyriboNucleic Acid) 
   - In cells preparing to divide, the chromosomes may be made visible using a dye that appears blue when bound to the DNA
   - Before cells divide, DNA is replicated then each copy is given to the cellular offspring
   - These chromosomes given to each offspring - each chromosome contains a very long DNA molecule with hundreds or thousands of genes
   - DNA molecule is made of two long chains, strands, arranged in a double helix
   - Specific sequences of the nucleotides A, T, C, and G encode the information
   - Nucleotides are essentially a four letter alphabet
   - Gene expression - the entire process by which the information in a gene directs the manufacture of a cellular product
     - Sequence of nucleotides along a gene is transcribed into mRNA which is then translated into a linked series of protein building blocks called amino acids
     - Amino acid chain then forms a special protein with a unique shape and function
   - The universality of genetic code is strong evidence that all life is related
     - Comparing sequences in several species for a gene that codes for a particular protein can provide valuable information for relationships between species
   - mRNA is translated into protein but other cellular RNAs function differently such as regulating the functioning of protein-coding genes
   - DNA ensures faithful inheritance of genetic information from generation to generation

*** Genomics: Large-Scale Analysis of DNA Sequences
   - *Genome* - the entire "library" of genetic instructions that an organism inherits
     - A typical human cell has two similar sets of chromosomes, each set has ~3 billion nucleotide pairs of DNA
   - *Genomics* - the study of whole sets of genes in one or more species
   - *Proteomics* - the study of sets of proteins and their properties
   - *Proteome* - the entire set of proteins expressed by a given cell, tissue, or organism
   - These two approaches are possible by three important research developments
     - "high throughput" technology
     - *Bioinformatics* - the use of computational tools to store, organize, and analyze the huge volume of data that results from high-throughput methods
     - Formation of interdisciplinary research teams - groups of diverse specialists that may include computer scientists, mathematicians, engineers, chemist, physicists, and of course, biologists from a variety of fields.
*** Theme: Life Requires the Transfer and Transformation of Energy and Matter
   - Fundamental characteristic of living organisms is their use of energy to carry out life's activities
   - *Producers* - plants and other photosynthetic organisms
   - *Consumers* - organisms, suhc as animals, that feed on other organisms or their remains
*** Theme: From Molecules to Ecosystems, Interactions are Important in Biological Systems
*** Molecules: Interactions Within Organisms
   - Interactions between components that make up living organisms - organs, tissues, cells, and molecules - are crucial to their smooth operation.
   - The key is the ability of many biological processes to self-regulate by a mechanism called feedback
   - Feedback regulation - when the output or product of a process regulates that very process
   - Negative feedback - a loop in which the response reduces the initial stimulus
*** Ecosystems: An Organism's Interactions with Other Organisms and the Physical Environment
   - At this level, every organism interacts with other organisms
   - These interactions help regulate the functioning of the ecosystem as a whole
   - Human interaction with our ecosystem
     - Climate Change - a directional change to the global climate that lasts three decades or more
*** The Core Theme: Evolution accounts for the unity and diversity of life
   - Evolution is the one idea that makes logical sense of everything we know about living organisms
   - Live has been evolving on Earth for billions of years
   - *Evolution* - the concept that the organisms living on earth today are modified descendance of common ancestors
   - Theodosius Dobzhansky, "Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution"
*** Classifying the Diversity of Life
   - Diversity is a hallmark of life
   - Names of species
     - Two part name, the first part is the name of the genus (plural, genera) to which the species belongs, the second is unique to the species within the genus
   - Known species to date (book date), 100,000 species of fungi, 290,000 plant species, 57,000 vertebrate species, 1 million insect species - myriad types of single-celled organisms
	The Three Domains of Life:
   - Domain Bacteria
   - Domain Archaea
   - Domain Eukarya
     - Kingdom Plantae
     - Kingdom Fungi
     - Protists
     - Kingdom Animalia
   - All organisms divided into three groups, Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya
   - Bacteria and Archaea are prokaryotic
   - All Eukaryotes (organisms with eukaryotic cells) are in domain Eukarya
     - Subgroups organized by how they get their energy
       - Plants: photosynthesis
       - Fungi: absorbing from surroundings
       - Animals: eating
       - Protists?
   - Most numerous and diverse eukaryotes are the protists, mostly single-celled organisms
*** Unity and Diversity of Life
   - While life's is very diverse, it still displays remarkable unity
   - Important dimension in biology: the passage of time
   - History of life as documented by fossils and other evidence is the saga of a changing Earth billions of years old inhabited by an evolving cast of living forms

*** Charles Darn and the Theory of Natural Selection
   - Charles Darwin published his book, "On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection" in November 1859
     - Articulated two main points
       - The first was that contemporary species arose from succession of ancestors that differed from them, aka "Descent with modification"
       - Second point was that "natural selection" is a primary cause of descent with modification
   - Three observations from nature that led Darwin to this conclusion:
     - Individuals in a population vary in their traits, many of which seem to be heritable
     - A population can produce far more offspring than can survive to produce offspring of their own, competition for resources is inevitable
     - Species generally are suited to their environments, in other words they are adapted to their circumstances
   - Natural selection - Individuals with inherited traits that are better suited to the local environment are more likely to survive and reproduces  than less well-suited individuals. Over many generations, a higher and higher proportion of individuals in a population will have the advantageous traits. Evolution occurs as the unequal reproductive success of individuals ultimately leads to adaptation to their environment, as long as the environment remains the same.

** RN Chapter 2
*** The Chemical Context of Life
   - Nature is not neatly packaged into individual sciences - biology, chemistry, physics, and so forth
   - Matter consists of chemical elements in pure form and in combinations called compounds
   - Organisms are composed of matter
   - *Matter* - anything that takes up space and has mass
*** Elements and Compounds
   - *Element* - a substance that cannot be broken down to other substances by chemical reactions
   - 92 elements occurring in nature
   - *Compound* - a substance consisting of two or more different elements combined in a fixed ratio
     - NaCl
*** The Elements of Life
   - 20-25% of the 92 natural elements are essential elements that an organism needs to live a healthy life and reproduce
   - Some variation among organisms' essential elements
   - Humans need 25, plants only need 17
   - Four elements, O, C, H, and N, make up approximately 96% of living matter. Ca, P, K, and S and a few other elements account for most of the remaining 4% or so of an organism's mass
   - Trace Elements are required by an organism in only minute quantities
     - Fe, I is an essential ingredient of a hormone produced by the thyroid gland
   - Some naturally occurring elements are toxic to organisms
     - For humans, arsenic is one of these elements and can be lethal

*** Case Study: Evolution of Tolerance to Toxic Elements
   - Some plants have developed adaptations that allow them to thrive in serpentine areas that are usually toxic to plants 
*** Elements:
   - An element's properties depend on the structure of its atoms
   - *Atom* - is the smallest unit of matter that still retains the properties of an element

*** Subatomic Particles
   - Neutrons, protons, and electrons
   - Atomic nucleus - the center of the atom, protons give the nucleus a positive charge
   - Rapidly moving electrons form a :cloud" of negative charge around the nucleus
   - Units used to measure masses of atoms is dalton. (The dalton is the same as the atomic mass unit, or amu)
   - 1 dalton = the mass of 1 proton or 1 neutron
*** Atomic Number and Atomic Mass
   - Atomic number - number of protons which is unique to the element
     - Written as a subscript to the left of the symbol of that element
   - Mass number - total number of protons and neutrons in the atom
     - Superscript to the left of an element's symbol
   - Mass number is close to but slightly different from the total mass of an atom
     - Mass number of Na is 23 but its atomic mass is 22.9898 amu
*** Isotopes
   - *Isotopes* - different forms of the same element with differences in # of neutrons.
   - Radioactive isotope - one in which the nucleus decays spontaneously giving off particles and energy
*** Radioactive tracers
   - Radioactive fallout from nuclear accidents are very dangerous
   - Most isotopes used in medical diagnosis are relatively safe
*** Radiometric Dating
   - *Half-life* - the time it takes for 50% of the parent isotope to decay
   - Radiometric dating - when scientists measure the ratio of different isotopes and calculate how many half-lives (in years) have passed since an organisms was fossilized or a rockw as formed
*** The Energy Levels of Electrons
   - *Energy* - the capacity to cause change
   - Potential energy - the energy that matter possesses because of its location or structure
   - Electrons in an atom have potation energy due to their distance from the nucleus
   - Electrons going from lower to higher energy levels absorb energy and electrons going from higher to lower lose energy
   - Electron shells - a principal energy level, may be thought of as an orbit followed by electrons around an atom's nucleus
*** Electron Distribution and Chemical Properties
   - Valence electrons - the electrons in the outermost shell
   - Valence shell - the outermost electron shell
   - Elements with the same electron configurations have similar chemical properties
   - Elements with full valence shells are inert, chemically unreactive
*** Electron Orbitals
   - In early 1900s, electron shells were visualized as concentric paths of electrons orbiting the nucleus
   - Now we know the concentric circle represents only the average distance between an electron in that shell and the nucleus
   - *Orbital* - the three-dimensional space where an electron is found 90% of the time
   - Orbitals are components of electron shells
*** The formation and function of molecules depend on chemical bonding between atoms (2.3)
*** Covalent bonds
   - Covalent bond - sharing of a pair of valence electrons by two atoms
     - Between two nonmetals
   - *Molecule* - two mor more atoms held together by covalent bonds
   - Single bond, two shared electrons (between both)
   - Double bond - sharing two pairs of valence electrons
   - *Valence* - the bonding capacity of an atom, aka the number of unpaired electrons required to complete the atom's outermost (valence) shell
   - *Electronegativity* - the attraction of a particular atom for the electrons of a covalent bond
   - More electronegativity => pulls shared electrons towards itself more strongly
   - Nonpolar covalent bond - when the electronegativity of the bonding atoms is not great and thus the bond is nonpolar
   - Polar covalent bond - when the electronegativities are very different and one atom is pulling much more than the other
*** Ionic Bonds
   - *Ions* - positively or negatively charged atoms 
   - *Cation* - a positively charged ion
   - *Anion* - a negatively charged ion
   - Ionic bond - the attraction between cations and anions
   - Ionic compounds, salts - compounds formed by ionic bonds
   - Salts are hard in their dry, solid form, but when put in water dissolve easily.
*** Hydrogen Bonds
   - Hydrogen bond - attraction between a hydrogen and an electronegative atom
*** Van der Waals Interactions
   - Electrons are not always evenly distributed, thus molecules may have positively and negatively charge regions at times
   - Van der Waals interactions - individually weak and occur only when atoms and molecules are very close together; attractions between the temporarily positive and negatively charged parts of molecules
*** Molecular Shape and Function
   - A molecule has a characteristic size and shape which are key to its function in the living cell
   - Molecular shape is critical: determines how the molecules interact
*** Chemical reactions make and break chemical bonds (2.4)
   - Chemical reactions - the making and breaking of chemical bonds leading to change sin composition of matter
   - *Reactants* - starting materials in a chemical reaction
   - *Products* - resulting materials in a ^
   - Photosynthesis chemical reaction = 6CO2 + 6H2O + Sunlight --> C6H12O6 + 6O2
   - Chemical equilibrium - the point at which the reactions offset one another exactly
     - Also when the rate of the reaction = the rate of the opposite reaction
   - *Equilibrium* - the concentrations of the reactants and products have stabalized at a particular ratio

*** Water and Life

*** The Molecule That Supports All Life
   - Polar covalent bonds in water molecules result in hydrogen bonding
   - Water is the substance that makes life possible as we know it on Earth
   - Ice floats on water, a rare property
   - Polar covalent bonds - because oxygen is more electronegative than hydrogen, electrons of the covalent bonds spend more time closer to oxygen than to hydrogen
   - Polar molecule - overall charge is unevenly distributed
     - Water, the oxygen has two regions of partial negative charge and each hydrogen has a partial positive charge
*** Four emergent properties of water contribute to Earth's suitability for life
   - Cohesive behavior
   - Ability to moderate temperature
   - Expansion upon freezing
   - Versatility as a solvent
*** Cohesion of Water Molecules
   - *Cohesion* - hydrogen bonding keeps water molecules close together 
   - Surface tension - hydrogen bonding is responsible for water's surface tension - related to cohesion
   - Water has high specific heat 
   - *Adhesion* - the clinging of one substance to another
   - At water's surface, the molecules are bonded together using hydrogen bonding meaning, that the water has a high surface tension.
   - Kinetic Energy - the energy of motion
     - The faster the molecule moves, the more its kinetic energy
   - Thermal energy - the kinetic energy associated with the random movement of atoms or molecules
   - *Temperature* - the average kinetic energy of the molecules in a body of matter, regardless of volume
   - *Heat* - thrmal energy in transfer from one body of matter to another
   - *Calorie* - a unit of heat, defined by the energy it takes raise the temperature of 1 g of water by 1ºC
   - *Kilocalorie* - 1,000 cal
   - Joul (J) = 0.239 cal, one calorie equals 4.184 J
   - Specific heat - the amount of heat that must be absorbed or lost for 1 g of that substance to change its temperature by 1ºC
   - Water has a high specific heat because of hydrogen bonding - resistant to change in temperature
*** Evaporative Cooling
   - When molecules move fast enough to break apart, they evaporate and become gas
   - Heat of vaporization - the quantity of heat a liquid must absorb for 1 g of it to be converted from the liquid to the gaseous state
   - Evaporative cooling - when molecules on the surface of a liquid evaporate, the rest of the liquid cools down because it loses the energy  
*** Floating on Water
   - Water is one of the few substances that are less dense as a solid than a liquid
   - At temperatures above 0°C, water behaves like other liquids 
   - When temperatures fall between 4°C and 0°C what are begins to freeze 
   - 0°C - when water molecules form crystal lattices
   - Ice is 10% less dence than water
   - Floating ice insulates the oceans/bodies of water below it so that other life can thrive
*** Water: The Solvent of Life
   - *Solution* - a liquid that is a completely homogeneous mixture of two or more substances
   - *Solvent* - dissolving agent of the solution
   - *Solute* - substance that is dissolved - Often water
   - Aqueous solution - one in which the solute is dissolved in water; water is the solvent
   - Water is a very versatile solvent
   - Hydration shell - sphere of water molecules around a dissolved ion
   - Water can dissolve all the ions as a result of its positive and negative sides (its polarity)
   - A compound does not need to be ionic to dissolve in water
*** Hydrophilic and Hydrophobic Substances
   - *Hydrophilic* - (From the Greek hydro, water, and philos, loving) - any substance that has an affinity for water
   - *Hydrophobic* - nonionic and nonpolar (or otherwise cannot form hydrogen bonds) substances that seem to repel water
*** Solute Concentration in Aqueous Solutions
   - Molecular mas - the sum of the masses of all the atoms in a molecule
   - Mole (mol) - an exact number of objects: 6.022*10^23 - the chemist's dozen
   - *Molarity* - the number of moles of solute per liter of solution
*** Possible Evolution of Life on Other Planets
   - *Astrobiologists* - biologists who look for life elsewhere in the universe
   - Looking for planets that have or might have water
*** Acidic and basic conditions affect living organisms
   - Hydrogen ion (H+) - a single proton with a charge of 1+
   - Hydroxide ion (OH-) - a charge of 1-
   - Hydronium ion (H3O+) - a molecule with a charge of 1+
   - H+ is used to represent H3O+. However, H+ does not exist on its own, will always be associated with a water molecule in the form H3O+
   - Double arrows in a chemical reaction mean it is reversible
   - H+ and OH- are very reactive
   - Dissociation of water is reversible and statically rare
*** Acids and Bases
   - *Acid* - a stubstance that increases the hydrogen ion concentration of a solution
   - *Base* - a substance that reduces the hydrogen ion concentration
*** The pH Scale
   - [H+][OH-] = 10^-14
   - [x] = molar concentration of x
   - Neutral solution at 25ºC
     - [H+] = 10^-7
     - [OH-] = 10^-7
   - pH of a solution - the negative logarithm (base 10) of the hydrogen ion concentration: pH=−log⁡[H^+ ]
*** Buffers
   - *Buffer* - a substance that minimizes changes in the concentrations of H+ and OH- in a solution
*** Acidification
   - Ocean acidification - when CO2 dissolves in seawater, it reacts with water to form carbonic acid which lowers the ocean's pH
   - Extra hydrogen ions combine with carbonate ions (CO_3^2-) to form bicarbonate ions (HCO3-) thereby reducing the carbonate ion concentration

** RN Chapter 4
*** Key Concepts:
	1. Organic chemistry is the study of carbon compounds
	2. Carbon atoms can form diverse molecules by bonding to four other atoms
	3. A few chemical groups are key to molecular function

*** Topics: Properties of smaller molecules
*** Carbon: The Backbone of Life
   - Carbon is unparalleled in its ability to form molecules that are large, complex, and varied
   - Proteins, dna, carbohydrates, other molecules that distinguish living matter from inanimate material all composed of carbon atoms bonded to one another and to atoms of diff elements
     - H, O, N, S, P
   - Emergent properties arise the organization of matter in living organisms
   - Concept 4.1
   - Organic chemistry - compounds containing carbon
   - Organic chemistry redefied - the study of carbon compounds, regardless of origin

*** Organic Molecules and the Origin of Life on Earth
   - Experiment Figure 4.2
     - Inquiry: Can organic molecules form under conditions estimated to simulate those on the early Earth?
     - Experiment: In 1953, Stanley Miller set up a closed system to mimic conditions thought at the time to have existed on the early Earth. A flask of water simulated the primeval sea. The water was heated so the some vaporized and moved in a second, higher flask containing the "atmosphere" -- a mixture of gases. Sparks were discharged in the synthetic atmosphere to mimic lightning.
     - Results: Miller identified a variety of organic molecules that are common in organisms. These included simple compounds, such as formaldehyde (CH2O) and hydrogen cyanide (HCN), and more complex molecules, such as amino acids and long chains of carbon and hydrogen known as hydrocarbons.
     - Conclusion: Organic molecules, a first step in the origin of life, may have been synthesized abiotically on the early Earth. Although new evidence indicates that the early Earth's atmosphere was different from the "atmosphere" used by Miller in this experiment, recent experiments using the revised list of chemicals also produced organic molecules. (Will explore hypothesis in more detail in Concept 25.1)
   - Moles and molar ratios
   - Carbon forms 4 bonds
   - Great diversity of living organisms is made possible by the unique chemical versatility of the element carbon
*** The Formation of Bonds with Carbon
   - Carbon: 6 electrons, 4 valence electrons, usually completes its valence shell (which can hold 8 electrons) by sharing its 4 electrons so that 8 electrons are present
   - In organic molecules, carbon usually forms single or double covalent bonds
   - Some organic molecules (Figure 4.3) (Refer to figure to see the models and structural formula)
		Molecule and Molecular Shape	Molecular Formula
		Methane. When a carbon atom has four single bonds to other atoms, the molecule is tetrahedral	CH4
		Ethane. A molecule may have more than one tetrahedral group of single-bonded atoms. (Ethane consists of two such groups.)	C2H6
		Ethene (ethylene). When two carbon atoms are joined by a double bond, all atoms attached to those carbons are in the same plane, and the molecule is flat.	C2H4
   - Tetrahedral bond angles are 109.5 (in case you forgot)
   - *Valence* - the number of covalent bonds an atom can form, the number of unpaired electrons
   - Urea, CO(NH2)2, is the organic compound found in urine that Wohler synthesized in the early 1800s
*** Molecular Diversity Arising from Variation in Carbon Skeletons
   - Variation in carbon skeletons is one important source of the molecular complexity and diversity that characterize living matter
*** Hydrocarbons
   - *Hydrocarbons* - organic molecules consisting of only carbon and hydrogen
     - Atoms of hydrogen are attached to the carbon skeleton
   - *Hydrocarbons* - major components of petrolium
*** Isomers
   - *Isomers* - compounds that have the same number so atoms of the same elements but different structures and hence different properties
     - Structural isomers - differ in the covalent arrangements of their atoms
     - Cis-trans isomers - carbons have covalent bonds to the same atoms, but these atoms differ in their spatial arrangements due to the inflexibility of double bonds
       - Arrangement with x on both sides is called a cis isomer and on opposite sides is called a trans isomer
     - *Enantiomers* - isomers that are mirror images of each other and that differ in shape due to the presence of an asymmetric carbon (one that is attached to four different atoms or groups of atoms)
*** A few chemical groups are key to molecular function
   - Hydrocarbons are the underlying framework for more complex organic molecules
*** The Chemical Groups Most Important in the Processes of Life
   - Estradiol (a type of estrogen) and testosterone
     - Female and male sex hormones
   - Functional groups - chemical groups directly involved in chemical reactions
   - Seven chemical groups most important in biological processes are the hydroxyl, carbonyl, carboxyl, amino, sulfhydryl, phosphate, and methyl
   - First six can be chemically reactive, all except sulfhydryl group are hydrophilic and thus increase the solubility of organic compounds in water
   - Methyl group is not reactive, but serves as a recognizable tag on biological molecules
   - For more information on chemical groups: Figure 4.9
*** ATP: An Important Source of Energy for Cellular Processes
   - Adenosine triphosphate, or ATP - an organic phosphate molecule, adenosine attached to a string of three phosphate groups
     - HOPO3^2-
     - Often abbreviated as a circle with a P and subtext i under it

** RN Chapter 5
*** Key Concepts:
1. Macromolecules are polymers, built from monomers

*** The Molecules of Life
- *Macromolecules* - members of three classes: carbohydrates, proteins, and nucleic acids (fourth not in macromolecules is lipids)
- Concept 5.1
- *Polymer* - a long molecule consisting of bonds, much as a train consists of a chain of cars
- (Greek, polys, many)
- *Monomers* - smaller molecules, repeating units that serve as building blocks of a polymer
- (Greek, monos, single)
The Synthesis and Breakdown of Polymers
- *Enzymes* - cells that facilitate the process of making and breaking down polymers
- *Dehydration reaction* - a reaction in which two molecules are covalently bonded to each other with the loss of a water molecule
- *Hydrolysis* - "a process that is essentially the reverse of a dehydration reaction"
  - (Greek, hydro, water, and lysis, break)
  - Bond between monomers is broken by the addition of a water molecule
- *Polymerization* - When monomers are added together
- Food we eat is attacked by various enzymes speeding up hydrolysis
 
*** Concept 5.2
- *Carbohydrates - sugars and polymers of sugars - simplest carbohydrates are monosaccharides, or simple sugars* - disaccharides: double sugars
- *Carbohydrates macro molecules* - polymers called polysaccharides, composed of many sugar building blocks
- Sugars
- Monosaccharides (from the Greek monos, single, and sacchar, sugar) molecular formulas that are some multiple of the unit CH2O
- Glucose (C6H12O6) the most common monosaccharide
- Most names for sugars end in -ose
- Glucos, fructose, six carbons long
- Trioses, pentoses
- Glucose molecules + other five- and six-carbon sugars, form rings because they are the most stable form of these sugars under physiological conditions
- Asymmetric carbon is a carbon attached to four different atoms or groups of atoms
- *Cellular respiration* - when cells extract energy from glucose molecules by breaking them down in a series of reactions
- *Disaccharide* - two monosaccharides joined by a glycosidic linkage, a covalent bond formed between two monosaccharides by a dehydration reaction (glyco refers to carbohydrate)
- *Polysaccharides* - macromolecules, polymers with a few hundred to a few thousand monosaccharides joined by glycosidic linkages
- *Starch* - a polymer of glucose monomers, as granules within cellular structures known as plastids
- Plastids include chloroplasts
- Synthesizing starch enables the plant to stockpile surplus glucose
- Glucose is a major cellular fuel, starch represents stored energy
- *Glycogen* - a polymer of glucose that is like amylopectin but more extensively branched
  - Vertebrates store glycogen mainly in liver and muscle cells
  - Hydrolysis of glycogen in these cells releases glucose when demand for sugar increases
  - Glycogen stores are depleted in about a day unless they are replenished by eating
- Issue of concern in low-carbohydrate diets, which can result in weakness and fatigue
- Structural Polysaccharides
- *Cellulose* - major component of the tough walls that enclose plant cells
- Globally, plants produce almost 10^14 kg (100 billion tons) of cellulose per year
  - Most abundant organic compound on earth
- Greek letters are often used as a numbering system for biology 
- Glucose has alpha and beta where the first has a hydroxyl group attached to number 1 carbon below, and the next above the plane of the ring
- Cellulose is never branched and is always straight
- In plant cell walls, parallel cellulose molecules held together by hydrogen-bonds with the hydroxyls are called microfibrils
- Cable-like microfibrils are a strong building material for plants
- Cellulose makes passage through the digestive tract easier because it stimulates the lining of the tract to secrete mucus
- Some Microorganisms can digest cellulose
- *Chitin* - important structural polysaccharide, used by arthropods (insects, spiders, crustaceans, and related animals)
- Concept 5.3
- *Lipids* - one class of large biological molecules that does not include true polymers, lipids mix poorly if at all, with water
- *Fat* - constructed from two kinds of smaller molecules: glyceral, and fatty acids
- *Fatty acids* - long carbon skeleton, usually 16-18, carbon atoms in length, carbon at the end of the skeleton is party of a carboxyl group
- Fats separate from water because the water molecules bond to one another and exclude fats
- *Ester linkage* - a bond formed by a dehydration reaction between hydroxyl group and a carboxyl group
- *Triacylglycerol* - resulting fat when three fatty acid molecules are joined to glycerol by an ester linkage
- *Saturated fatty acid* - when there are no double bonds between carbon atoms composing a chain and as many hydrogen atoms as possible are bonded to the carbon skeleton
- *Unsaturated fatty acid* - one or more double bonds with one fewer hydrogen atom on each double bonded carbo
- Nearly every double bond in naturally occurring fatty acids is a cis double bond (creates a kink in the hydrocarbon chain
- Peanut butter is delicious
- *Trans fats* - hydrogenated oils with unsaturated fats with trans double bonds
- *Phospholipid* - has two fatty acids attached to glycerol , third hydroxyl group of glycerol is joined to a phosphate group which has a negative electrical charge in the cell
- *Phospholipid bilayer* - double-layered sheet that phospholipids self-assemble into when added to water
  - forms a boundary between the cell and its external environment and establishes separate compartments within eukaryotic cells
- *Steroids* - lipids characterized by a carbon skeleton consisting of four fused rings
- *Cholesterol - a type of lipid steroid* - is a crucial molecule in animals
*** Concept 5.4
- *Catalysts* - chemical agents that selectively speed up chemical reactions without being consumed in the reaction
  - Can be used over and over again
  - Workhorses that keep cells running by carrying out the processes of life
- Human has tens of thousands of different proteins
- Each protein has a unique three-dimensional shape

- *Polypeptide* - a polymer of amino acids
- *Protein* - a biologically functional molecule made up of one or more polypeptides
  - Each folded into a specific three-dimensional structure
**** Amino Acid Monomers
- *Amino acid* - an organic molecule with both an amino group and a carboxyl group (see figure 4.9, previous chapter's notes)
  - Center of an amino acid has an asymmetric carbon atom called an alpha (greek letter alpha) carbon
  - Four different partners are an amino group, carboxyl group, hydrogen atom, and variable group symbolized by R (side chain)
- *R group - aka side chain* - differs from each amino acid
- (figure 5.14)
- *Primary structure* - a protein's sequence of amino acids
- *Secondary structure* - the result of hydrogen bonds between the repeating constituents of the polypeptide backbone (not the amino acid side chains)
- *α helix* - a delicate coil held together by hydrogen bonding between every fourth amino acid
- *β pleated sheet* - when two or more segments of the polypeptide chain lying side by side (called β strands) are connected by hydrogen bonds between parts of the two parallel segments of polypeptide backbone
- *Tertiary structure* - the overall shape of a polypeptide resulting from interactions between the side chains (R groups) of the various amino acids
- *Hydrophobic interaction - a a type of interaction that contributes to tertiary structure* - when a polypeptide folds into its functional shape, amino acids with hydrophobic (nonpolar) side chains usually end up in clusters at the core of the protein out of contact with water
- *Disulfide bridges* - covalent bonds that may further reinforce the shape of a protein
  - Form where two cysteine monomers 
- *Quaternary structure* - the overall protein structure that results from the aggregation of the polypeptide subunits
- *Collagen* - the girders of connective tissue in skin, bones, tendons, ligaments, and other body parts (collagen accounts for 40% of the protein in a human body)
**** Sickle-Cell Disease: A Change in Primary Structure
- Even a slight change in primary structure can affect a protein's shape and ability to function
- *Sickle-cell disease* - an inherited blood disorder caused by the substitution of one amino acid (valine) for the normal one (glutamic acid) at the position of the sixth amino acid in the primary structure of hemoglobin
  - Abnormal hemoglobin molecules tend to aggregate into chains, deforming some of the cells into a sickle shape
- *Hemoglobin* - the protein that carries oxygen in red blood cells
- *Key factors in determining protein structure* - a polypeptide chain of a given amino acid sequence can be arranged into three-dimensional shape determined by the interactions responsible for secondary and tertiary structure
- *Denaturation* - when pH, salt concentration, temperature, or other aspects of a protein's environment are altered, the weak chemical bonds and interactions within a protein may be destroyed causing the protein to unravel and lose its native shape
  - Denaturation agents include
- Chemicals that disrupt the hydrogen bonds, ionic bonds, or disulfide bridges that maintain a protein's shape
- Excessive heat, which agitates the polypeptide chain enough to overpower the weak interactions that stabalize the structure
- *X-ray crystallography* - method most commonly used to determine the 3-D structure of a protein is X-ray crystallography which depends on diffraction of an x-ray beam by the atoms of a crystallized molecule
  - Scientists can then build a 3-D model that shows the exact position of every atom in a protein molecule
- *(Nuclear magnetic resonance) NMR, spectroscopy, and bioinformatics* - complementary approaches to understanding protein structure and function
- A significant number of proteins, or regions of proteins, do no thave a distinct 3-D structure until they interact with a target protein or other molecule
  - 20-30% of mammalian proteins
  - Intrinsically disordered proteins are the focus of current research
- Concept 5.5
- *Gene* - a discrete unit of inheritance
  - Consist of DNA, which belongs to class of compounds called nucleic acids
- *Nucleic acids* - polymers made of monomers called nucleotides
  - Two types of nucleic acids
- Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)
- ribonucleic acid (RNA) 
- Gene expression
  - DNA provides directions for its own replication,
  - Also directs RNA synthesis and through RNA controls protein synthesis
- DNA --> RNA --> protein
- *Polynucleotides* - nucleic acids are macromolecules that exist as polymers
- *Nucleotides* - monomers that make up polynucleotides
  - Composed of three parts, a five-carbon sugar (pentose), a nitrogen containing (nitrogenous) base, and one to three phosphate groups
- Beginning monomer used to build a polynucleotide has three phosphate groups, two lost during the polymerization process
- *Nucleoside* - the portion of a nucleotide without any phosphate groups
- Nitrogenous bases because the nitrogen atoms tend to take up H+ from solution, thus acting as bases
- Pyrimidine has one six-membered ring of carbon and nitrogen atoms
  - Members of the pyrimidine family
- Cytosine (C)
- Thymine (T)
- Uracil (U)
- *Purines* - larger, with six-membered ring fused to a five-membered ring
  - Adenine (A)
  - Guanine (G)
- *Deoxyribose* - the sugar in DNA
- *Ribose* - the sugar in RNA
- Deoxyribose lacks an oxygen atom in the second carbon in the ring, hence the name deoxyribose
- Linkage of nucleotides into a polynucleotide involves a dehydrationr eaction
The Structures of DNA and RNA Molecules
- *Double helix* - two polynucleotides or "strands" that wind around an imaginary axis
- Two sugar-phosphate backbones run in opposite 5'-->3' directions from each other
- *Antiparallel* - parallel but not moving in the same direction (opposite)
- *tRNA* - brings amino acids to the ribosome during the synthesis of a polypeptide

     - Cellular Respiration Overview
     - Steps of Glycolysis
     - Preparation for Citric Acid Cycle
     - Steps of Citric Acid Cycle
     - Substrate-Level Phosphorylation
   - Organisms need Energy
     - Lots of active processes (ex. Active transport across the membrane)
     - Energy is extracted from macromolecules and stored in ATP
       - Eating
     - Oxidation of sugar
       - By Cellular Respiration - most prevalent and efficient
       - By Fermentation - Usually done in times of dire need
     - Cellular Respiration
   - Cellular Respiration Overview:
   - Prokaryotes are doing this too, cellular respiration is a fairly universal process
   - So you eat some food…
     - Your intestines break down the carbohydrates into simple sugars (ex. Glucose)
     - Absorb glucose through intestinal cells into blood
     - Blood delivers glucose to all of yours cells
     - Excess glucose is stored as glycogen
     - Transport of glucose across the plasma membrane occurs through 2º Active Transport
   - Glycolysis
     - First steps of cellular respiration
     - Break down glucose to pyruvate
     - Produces small amount of energy
     - Occurs in the presence or absence of O2
   - Energy Investment Phase
     - Glucose -> Glucose 6-Phosphate -> Fructose -> 6-phosphate -> Fructose 1,6-biphosphate --2> Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P), Dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) 
     - Kinase :: phosphorylates a molecule
   - Energy Payoff Phase
     - Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate -> 1,3-Bisphosphoglycerate -> 3-Phosphoglycerate - > 2-Phosphoglycerate -> 2-Phosphoglycerate -> Phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) -> Pyruvate
   - Substrate-Level phosphorylation
     - ATP Formed from taking the phosphate group from a substrate and putting it on ADP
     - The enzyme is a kinase
     - Can only happen with substrates due to the change in free energy (∆G)
   - Glycolysis Summary
   - The Citric Acid Cycle
     - Also known as the "Krebs Cycle" and the "TCA Cycle" (Tricarboxylic Acid Cycle)
     - Only occurs if O2 is present
     - [[file:./Week 5/citricacidcycle.png]]
   - Preparing Pyruvate (Import)
     - Transport into the mitochondrion only needs to occur in eukaryotes
     - Active transport
     - Remove fully oxidized carbon as CO2
   - Citric Acid Cycle
   - Summary of Citric Acid Cycle 
     - Every time you remove CO2 you reduce NAD+
     - Through preparing pyruvate and the Citric Acid Cycle:
       - 3CO2+3NADH
       - One of everything else
         - NADH
         - FADH2
         - ATP
   - Take Home Message…
     - Glycolysis breaks one six carbon sugar (clucose) into two three carbon sugars (pyruvate), yielding 2 ATP and 2 NADH
     - Pyruvate is converted into acetyl-CoA, yielding 1 NADH per molecule
     - Acetyl-CoA enters the citric acid cycle, producing 3 NADH 1 FADH2, and 1 ATP
     - The full oxidation of glucose yields 6CO2, 3ATP, and lots of reduced electron carriers
     - ATP were formed by substrate-level phosphorylation

*** Oxidative Phosphorylation
   - Main Topics
     - Finally getting the most out of that glucose 
     - Using those electrons from NADH
       - The Electron Transport Chain
     - Making ATP
       - Chemiosmosis
   - Cellular Respiration
     - So far, per glucose
       - Net 4 ATP
       - 10 NADH
       - 2 FADH2
   - Oxidative Phosphorylation
       - Cyt C = Cytochrome C
       - Q = ubiquinone
   - Where it happens:
     - *Eukaryotes* - Inner mitochondrial Membrane
     - *Prokaryotes* - Plasma Membrane
   - The Electron Transport Chain
     - Chain of protein complexes and coenzymes associated with the inner mitochondrial membrane
     - Cristae lead to large surface area of inner mitochondrial membrane
   - A Chain of Redox Reactions
     - NADH passes its electrons to Complex I
     - FADH2 passes its electrons to Complex II
     - NADH and FADH2 are oxidized so Complexes I and II are reduced
   - Flow of Electrons
   - Proton Pumps
     - Each transmembrane protein complex uses the energy from the flow of electrons to pump protons out of the mitochondrial matrix
     - Sets up an electrochemical gradient
   - Chemiosmosis
     - ATP synthase allows protons to flow down their gradient
     - The flow of protons turns the protein complex in the inner mitochondrial membrane
     - Turning of the protein complex causes ATP synthesis
   - Energy from Cellular Respiration
     - Make ~3 ATP per NADH
     - Make ~2 ATP per FADH2
       | Process            | Net (per glucose) |         ATP Yield |
       | Glycolysis         | 2 ATP             |                 2 |

       |                    |                   | 38 ATP Max. Total |
		
   - Energy from Cellular Respiration
     - Most of the energy extracted from glucose during the Citric Acid Cycle
     - Differs between prokaryotes and eukaryotes
     - ATP yield per molecule of glucose at each stage of cellular respiration
       - 30-32 ATP per glucose. Maximum = 38 ATP
   - Efficiency of Cellular Respiration
     - 40% of energy available in glucose is stored in ATP due to cellular respiration
     - The rest (60%) is released as heat
     - The engine in your car is about 25% efficient
   - Regulation of Cellular Respiration
     - Citrate and ATP are noncompetitive inhibitors that bind an allosteric site (not active site)
   - Take Home Message:
     - NADH and FADH2 pass their electrons to the electron transport chain (ETC)
     - ETC is a chain of redox reactions that results in the reduction of O2 into H2O
     - The purpose of the ETC is to generate a proton gradient that is used by ATP synthase to generate ATP
     - Most of the energy from glucose was extracted during the Citric Acid Cycle
     - Cellular Respiration is controlled by negative feedback loops

* Week 6
** OB010.06.L1 - Fermentation
   - In this lecture
     - Fermentation vs. Cellular respiration
     - Types of Fermentation
     - Human uses of Fermentation
   - Cellular respiration requires O2
     - The Citric Acid Cycle and the Electron Transport Chain don't work with O2
   - [[file:./Week 6/makingatp.png]]
   - What if there is no O2?
     - Still need ATP
     - Can get ATP from glycolysis
     - [[file:./Week 6/glycolysis.png]]
     - If we run low on ATP, glycolysis is turned on
       - Bulk of ATP comes from glycolysis, inhibition stops
     - But to keep glycolysis running, we need NAD+, need a way to regenerate NAD+ from NADH
     - Normally would be done by electron transport chain, but that's not working without O2
   - Fermentation
     - Can regenerate NAD+
     - Ethanol and lactate are most common byproducts of fermentation
     - [[file:./Week 6/fermentation.png]]
     - Alcohol Fermentation
       - Some organisms produce ethanol as their fermentative byproduct
       - [[file:./Week 6/alcoholfermentation.png]]
   - Example: Choosing how to regenerate NAD+
     - Saccharomyces cerevisiae (fungus), aka brewer's / baker's yeast!
     - [[file:./Week 6/example1regen.png]]
     - Fermentation => beer, cellular respiration => bread
   - Lactate Fermentation
     - Some organisms produce lactate as their fermentative byproduct
     - If you quickly use up the ATP in the muscles before more O2 can be supplied by the blood, your muscles will resort to fermentation
   - Human Exploitation of Fermentation
     - Humans have taken advantage of fermentation by bacteria and fungi from millenia
       - Alcohol Fermentation
	 - Grain => beer
	 - Fruit => wine
       - Lactate Fermentation
	 - Milk (from any animal)  => yogurt, cheese
	 - Cabbage => sauerkraut
	 - Preserved vegetables, kim chi
       - More examples:
	 - Vinegar is fermented alcohol
	 - Chocolate is fermented cocoa beans
	 - Miso is fermented grains
	 - Soy sauce is fermented grains
	 - Soy sauce is fermented soybeans
	 - Injera (Ethiopian/Eritrean bread) is fermented teff
	 - Vanilla is fermented orchid seed pods - Alcohol fermentation
	 - Salami is fermented sausage
   - Take home message...
     - Fermentation is used to regenerate NAD+ so that glycoloysis can continue (which produces ATP) in the absence of oxygen.
     - Fermentation creates various byproducts edepending on the organism doing the fermenting.
** OB010.06.L2 - Catabolism
   - In this lecture...
     - What are the other sources of energy?
     - How do we store extra energy for times of need?
   - Cellular respiration
     * [[file:./Week 6/cellularrespiration.png]]
   - So you eat some food...
     - You don't eat glucose alone.
     - Carbohydrates, fat, and protein
     - Carbohydrates
       - Glycogen in meat - polymer of glucose
       - Startch in some plants - polymer of glucose
       - Sucrose - dissacharide of glucose and fructose
     - Fat - broken down into glyceral and fatty acids
       - glycerol
     - Protein - broken down into amino acids
   - Catabolism of Carbs
     - Sugars enter the cellular respiration pathway as discussed
   - Catabolsim of Fats
     - Glycerol enters the pathway at glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
     - Fatty acids are broken down into Acetyl CoA
     - [[file:./Week 6/catabolism.png]]
     - Beta Oxidation of Fatty Acid
       1. Oxidize the fatty acid
       2. Breaking down the fatty acid tail 2 carbons at a time to form acetyl CoA
       3. Acetyl CoA enters the citric acid cycle
     - See - ../Week 6/oxidationfattyacid.png
   - Energy from Fat
     - More energy can be derived from metabolizing fat than from *any other source*
     - Full breakdown of 6 carbon sugar yielded ~38 ATP
     - Full breakdown of the average fat molecule yields *324* ATP!
     - Each turn of Citric Acid Cycle yields
       - 3 NADH
       - 1 FADH2
       - 1 ATP
     - Each fatty acid of a fat molecule has ~18 carbons
     - 54 carbons from fat = 27 turns of the cycle
       - 81 NADH = 243 ATP
       - 27 FADH2 = 54 ATP
       - 27 ATP
   - Fatty acid is a long hydrocarbon chain
   - Catabolism of Proteins
     - Amino acids not usually broken down for energy
     - Used to make new proteins
     - Humans cannot make some of the amino acids
       - They are "essential" to our diet
     - Essential Amino Acids:
       + Threonine
       + Methionine
       + Lysine
       + Valine
       + Leucine
       + Isoleucine
       + Histidine
       + Phenylalanine
       + Tryptophan
     - When amino acids are broken down for energy, must remove the nitrogen first
     - Waste product amonia is turned into urea (the primary component of urine)
   - Storing Extra Food
     - You eat 3 square meaels a day, but you need energy all of the time
     - Store extra glucose as glycogen in the liver
     - Store extra fat in fat cells (adipocytes, in belly, thighs, etc)
   - Releasing Stored Energy
     - Where do you get energy when you are not eating?
     - First, break down glycogen in the lvier.
       - Glycogen stores are used up after ~24 hours.
     - Then, break down fats. long-term storage
       - Fat stores will last about 1 month
     - Last ditch effort, break down proteins
       - Muscles get really weak and worn down
   - Take Home Message...
     - Other food sources enter the cellular respiration pathway at different points
     - Carbohydrates provide our short-term energy
     - Fat provides our long-term energy
     - Protein provides energy in times of dire need
     - You get the most energy out of fat (which is why it's so hard to get rid of it. because it's so good at storing energy)

       - Photosystem I (PSI) - P700 Chlorophyll A
     - Electrons flow through systems linearly or in a cycle
   - Noncyclic electron flow
     - Predominant Pathway
     - Generates ATP and NADPH from NADP+
       - Related to NADH and NAD+
       - P = Phosphate = photosynthesis?
   - Steps 1 and 2 - Exciting PSII
     - Energy from light excites the chlorophyll in PSII
     - Energy bounces around until it excites P680 chlorophyll
     - P680 passes its excited electrons to the primary electron receptor
   - Step 3 - Recharging P680
     - P680 has to get new electrons
     - An enzyme in the light-harvesting complex splits water
       - Electrons go to P680
       - Protons are released!
       - Oxygen is generated!
   - Steps 4 and 5 - Making ATP
     - Electrons passed from primary acceptor to an electron transport chain
     - Electrons lose energy along the way
     - Energy lost used to make ATP by photophosphorylation
     - [[file:./Week 6/photomakingatp.png]]
   - Step 6 - Exciting PSI
     - Meanwhile... light has excited chlorophyll of PSI
     - Energy bounces around until it excites P700 chlorophyll
     - P700 passes its excited electrons to the Primary Electron Acceptor
     - P700 gets new electrons from ETC
   - *All redox reactions*
   - Steps 7 and 8 - Reducing NADP+
     - Electrons passed from primary acceptor through an electron transport chain to NADP+
     - NADP+ is reduced to NADPH
       - Sound familiar?

** OB010.06.L4 - Calvin Cycle
   - 2 Reasons to Love Plants
     - They make the oxygen that we breathe (to use for cellular respiration)
     - They take carbon right out of the air (CO2) and turn it into chains of carbon (for use in all organic molecules!).
   - In this lecture...
     - How is the sugar made?
   - [[file:./Week 6/photosynthesis.png]]
   - The Calvin Cycle
     - Aka
       - The Dark Reactions (not because they happen in the dark but because they don't directly use energy from the sun)
       - The Light-Independent Reactions (however, they indirectly require energy from the sun by using the chemical energy from the light reactions)
     - The "synthesis" part of photosynthesis
   - =Phase 1: Fixing Carbon=
     - Fixing carbon int he incorporation of carbon from CO2 into an organic molecule
     - Enzyme responsible is Rubisco
   - =Phase 2: Reduction=
     - Add electrons to make G3P
     - Use ATP and NADPH from the light reactions
     - Tkae 3-Phosphoglycerate, use 6 ATP
     - Phosphorolate 1, 3-bisphosphoglycerate, use NADPH
     - Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
       - G3P
       - Is the output
   - =Phase 3: Regenerate RuBP=
     - Complete the cycle using more ATP from the light reactions
     - Notice that only 1 of the 6 G3P's is used to make other molecules
     - Other 5 G3P required to regenerate RuBP for the next round
   - [[file:./Week 6/thecalvincycle.png]]
   - G3P is used to make other organic molecules
     - [[file:./Week 6/G3P.png]]
   - Take Home Message...
     - The Calvin Cycle is used to take carbon out of the air and put it in organic molecules.
     - The product of photosynthesis is the starting point for all organic molecules.
     - Emergent Properties - none of the metabolic enzymes could do it on their own
** OB010.06.L5 - C3C4CAM minilecture
   - Fixation:
     - CO2 binds to RuBisCO -> 2 PGA
   - Photorespiration
     - O2 binds to RuBisCO -> PGA (Phosphoglycerate) + PG (Phosphoglycolate)
     - PGA's feed right into the Calvin cycle
     - PG is problematic, goes into a peroxome, into mitochondria, back to peroxome, then back to the Calvin cycle
   - C4 plants _\ /\ avoid \/ \_ photorespiration
     - [[file:./Week 6/c3vc4.png]]
     - *pep carboxylase*, greater affinity for CO2, gives *C4* product first
     - Moves the C4 into the bundle sheath cells
     - CO2 gets collected in the bundle sheath area
   - Pros and cons:
     - C3
       - bad: Photorespiration
       - good: "Low overhead"
     - C4
       - bad: Cost of C4 shuttle
       - good: Avoids photorespiration
     - Q: When is it worthwhile to avoid photorespiration?
       - C4 plants are especially good for places where it is hot, because their leaves are not constantly open
       - Concentration of CO2 means that it could possibly not pay off to have C4 plants
   - Crassulacean acid meatbolism :: "CAM"
     - Pineapple
     - CAM plants fix CO2 by night
     - Splitting what they do between night and day
     - During the night, their leaves open, and they don't lose much water
     - During the day, their leaves close and they don't lose water
     - Calvin cycle during the day, when they already have CO2 stored from the night
   - Take Home Points
     - C3
       - C3 cycle only, subject to photorespiration
       - cool
     - C4
       - Pack CO2 into bundle-sheath cells
       - hot
     - CAM
       - Fix CO2 by night, unpack and use by day
       - dry

** Study Tips - Kat Davis
*** Study Tips: Study actively!
    - Fill out the weekly objectives and key terms without help, then go through the book and review anything you missed
      - Even if you have already filled them out, it's still beneficial
    - Take the practice exam early
      - Use it as a diagnostic
    - Use the official OHS AP Bio quizlet
      - Go through this before the weekly objectives etc
    - Write down questions and concepts that we are shaky on and bring to class/office hours
    - Study groups: if you think joining a study group will help you stay motivated these are a good idea; however, if you think they will distract you, it would probably be best to study on your own

*** MC Practice
    - Mitochondrion are commmon to plant and animal cells
    - The phagocytic white blood cell would be best for studying lysosomes
    - Membranes of eukaryotic cells vary in that certain proteins are unique to each membrane
    - A greater portion of unsaturated phospholipids in the membrane will tend to increase membrane fluidity
    - if an enzyme is saturated with substrate, the most effective way to obtain a faster yield of product is to add more of the enzyme
    - when electrons flow along the electron transport chains of mitochondria, the pH of the matrix will increase
      - H+ concentration decreasees as they get pumped into the intermembrane space
    - photosynthesis in C4 plants and CAM plants is similar in that rubisco is not used to fix the carbon initially
    - release of oxygen happens much earlier than the calvin cycle does
    - phosphatase - enzyme that removes a phosphate
    - kinase - enzyme that addds a phosphate
    - Fermentation, just glycolysis
    - Anaerobic respiration - will try to go to the calvin cycle but because there's no O2, will go back and do fermentation
    - fermentation doesn't go beyond glycolysis, whereas anaerobic respiration has etc steps.
      - Some other terminal electron acceptor for anaerobic respiration like Nitrate
    - Both start with glycolysis
    - Both without O2
    - differences
      - Amount of ATP yield
      - fermentation doesn't go beyond glycolysis whereas anaerobic respiration has etc steps.
      - 2 ATP for fermentation
      - wider variety of yield from anaerobic respiration
      -

** OB010.8.L1 - Cell Signalling
*** In this lecture
    - Why cell signaling?
    - Essential Components of cell signaling
    - Types of cell signaling 
*** Cellular Responses
    - Cells must respond to their internal and external environments and changes to those environments.
      - Find food
      - Reproduce
      - Avoid pathogens
      - Repair damage
      - Know role as part of a multicellular organism
      - Many, many more reasons!
    - Accomplished through cell signaling
*** Cell Signaling
    - Receive the signal
    - Transduce the signal
    - Respond to the signal
    #+CAPTION: Example of cell detecting changes in external environment
    [[file:./Week 8/cellsignaling.png]]
*** Between cells that touch
    - Cell junctions
      - Gap junctions in animals and pasmodesmata in plants
      - Ex. human heart
    - Direct cell to cell signaling
      - Signal and receptor are transmembrane proteins
      - Ex. Development of multicellular organism
    #+CAPTION: Cells that touch
    [[file:./Week 8/celllsthattouch.png]]
*** Between Cells That Don't Touch
    - All involve release of a chemical that acts as the signal
    - Paracrine signaling
      - "Nearby"
      - Ex. Growth Factors
    - Synaptic signaling
      - Between synapses in a nervous system
    #+CAPTION: Cells that don't touch examples
    [[file:./Week 8/celldonttouch.png]]
    - Hormonal signaling
      - Signal (Hormone) released into blood
      - The Endocrine System
    #+CAPTION: Hormones
    [[file:./Week 8/hormonesignaling.png]]
    - A molecule can be released into the blood stream (a hormone) and can travel to your whole body
*** The Signal
    - Almost anything can act as a signal
    - Cells have evolved ways to sense important information
    - Often called the *ligand*
    - A *ligand* binds to a receptor
*** Between Cells that touch (again)
    - Cell junctions
      - Ions
      - Small molecules
    - Direct cell to cell signaling
      - Transmembrane Proteins
*** Signals between cells that don't touch
    - Paracrine and Synaptic signaling
      - Proteins
      - Peptides
      - Amino acid
      - AA derivatives
    - Hormonal (Endocrine) signaling
      - Hormone
*** Take Home Message
    - Cells need to respond to their internal and external environments.
    - Cell signaling requires
      - A signal (ligand)
      - A receptor
      - A transduction pathway
      - A response
    - Types of signaling
      - Cell junctions
      - Direct cell-to-cell signaling
      - Paracrine signaling
      - Synaptic signaling
      - Hormonal signaling
** OB010.8.L2 - Receptors
*** In this lecture
    - How does a cell receive a signal?
*** Sensing the Signal
    - Cells need a way to get the message
    #+CAPTION: Cell Signaling
    [[file:./Week 8/cellsignaling.png]]
*** Between Cells that Touch
    - Cell junctions
      - Intracellular receptor
    - Direct cell to cell signaling
      - Cell surface receptor (transmembrane protein)
*** Signals between cells that don't touch
    - Paracrine signaling
      - Cell surface receptor (transmembrane protein)
      - Intracellular receptor
    - Synaptic signaling
      - Cell surface receptor (transmembrane protein)
    - Hormonal (Endocrine) signaling
      - Cell surface receptor (transmembrane protein)
      - Intracellular receptor
*** Transmembrane Receptors
    - G-protein Coupled Receptor (GPCR)
      - Some of the most common receptors
      - two noted scientists won 2012 Nobel price for categorization of these receptors
    - Receptor Tyrosine Kinase (RTK)
    - Ligand-gated Ion Channel
*** G-Protein Coupled Receptors (GPCR)
    - Usually apss through plasma membrane seven times
    - Seven hydrophobic (because it's looping through phospholipid bilayer) alpha helices
    - Extracellular domain binds ligand (signal)
    - Receptor protein changes shape (conformation)
    - Intracellular domain interacts with G-protein
    #+CAPTION: G-protein-linked receptor
    [[file:./Week 8/g-proteinlinkedreceptor.png]]
    - receptor coupled to a G-protein (where the name comes from)
*** G Proteins
    - Small proteins that bind GTP
    - Usually active when bound to GTP and inactive when bound to GDP
    - G protein hydrolyzes GTP to GDP + P_i
    - Other proteins (receptors, enzymes, etc) can stimulate the G protein to
      - hydrolyze GTP -> helps turn the G protein off
      - exchange GDP for GTP -> turns G protein on
*** GPCR Signaling
    - When GPCR binds ligand, GPCR stimulates the G protein to exchange GDP for GTP
    - G protein is now active
    #+CAPTION: GPCR Signaling
    [[file:./Week 8/GPCRsignaling.png]]
    - Active G proteina ctivates the next enzyme
    - Activated enzyme initiates the cellular response and stimualtes the G protein to shut off
    - G protein hydrolyzes GTP
*** Receptor Tyrosine Kinases (RTK)
    - One helical transmembrane domain
    - Extracellular portion binds ligand
    - Intracellular portion is a kinase
    - Usually need to dimerize (2 need to interact) to be active
    #+CAPTION: RTK Receptors
    [[file:./Week 8/RTKReceptors.png]]
*** Why Tyrosine?
    - When you phosphorylate a protein, you have to add the phosphate group to a hydroxyl group.
    - Only 3 amino acids have hydroxyl groups
      - Tyrosine
      - Serine
      - Threonine
    #+CAPTION: 3 Amino Acids
    [[file:./Week 8/3aminoacids.png]]
*** RTK Signaling
    - 2 RTK proteins bind ligand, dimerize, and activate
    - Activated RTK proteins phosphorylate each other
    #+CAPTION: RTK Signaling
    [[file:./Week 8/RTKsignaling.png]]
    - Phosphate groups on RTK proteins recruit other signaling molecules, causing a cellular response
    - Signaling must be stopped by a phosphatase (an enzyme that removes phosphate groups)
*** Facilitated Diffusion - Channels
    - Open pore for specific molecules
    - Some channels are not always open
      - Gated Ion Channels
    #+CAPTION: Channel Proteins
    [[file:./Week 8/channelproteins.png]]
*** Ligand-gated Ion Channels
    - Channels opens when ligand is bound on the extracellular side
    - When the gate is open, ions can diffuse down their gradient
    - Ions initiate the cellular response
    - Gate closes when the ligand leaves
    #+CAPTION: Ligand-Gated Ion Channels
    [[file:./Week 8/ligand-gatedionchannels.png]]
*** Take Home Message
    - Intracellular receptors are required for internal signaling, signaling through cell junctions, and steroids
    - All other receptors are transmembrane proteins on the plasma membrane.
    - 3 main types of transmembrane receptors
      - G protein coupled receptors (GPCR)
      - Receptor Tyrosine Kinases (RTK)
      - Ligand-gated Ion Channel

** OB010.8.L3 - Signaling Responses
*** Cell Communication Part 2
    - What's happening inside the cell
    - What do cells do after they've received a signal?
*** Signal Transudction
    - Transduction is usually a multi-step cascade of events
    - Signal Transduction Pathway
    #+CAPTION: Cell Signaling
    [[file:./Week 8/cellsignaling.png]]
*** The Pathways
    - The first step of the pathway is receiving the signal
      - Discussed receptors in previous lecture
    - Types of Transduction Pathways
      - Kinase Cascade
      - Secondary Messengers
	- Cyclic AMP (cAMP)
	- Calcium (Ca2+)
*** Kinase Cascade
    #+CAPTION: Kinase Cascade
    [[file:./Week 8/kinase_cascade.png]]
    - Series of kinases that activate each other
    - Kinase 1 phosphorylates Kinase 2, etc
    - Generally, a protein is activated when phosphorylated by a *kinase*.
    - The protein is then inactivated when the phosphate is removed (dephosphorylated) by a *phosphatase*.
    - -2% of our genes are kinases
*** Secondary Messengers
    - Small molecules or ions that activate the next step in the pathway
    - Easily spread throughout the cell by diffusion
    - Most common secondary messengers
      - Cyclic AMP (cAMP)
      - Calcium ions (CA2+)
*** Cyclic AMP
    - Cyclic Adenosine MonoPhosphate
    - Formed by the enzyme adenylyl cyclase
    - Broken down by phosphodiesterase
    #+CAPTION: Cyclic AMP
    [[file:./Week 8/cyclicAMP.png]]
*** An example
    #+CAPTION: An example
    [[file:./Week 8/anexample.png]]
*** Calcium Ions
    - The concentration of calcium in the cytoplasm is generally *low*.
    - An increase in calcium concentration activates signal transduction pathways.
    #+CAPTION: Calcium Ions
    [[file:./Week 8/calciumions.png]]
*** The Response
    - Ultimately, the signaling pathway causese one or more specific cellular responses
    - Response in the cytoplasm or nucleus
*** Cytoplasmic Response
    - Usually affects the activity of an enzyme
    - For example...
      - A hormone (epinephrine) binds a GPCR (Reception)
      - The message is transduced through a G-protein, secondary messenger, and kinase cascade
      - Activates an enzyme that breaks down glycogen (More ATP!)
*** Nuclear Response
    - Change the regulation of a gene
    - Turn genes on and off
    - Takes longer than a cytoplasmic response
*** Response Specificity
    - Different cell types respond to the same signal because they express different proteins.
      - Different receptors
      - Different transduction
      - Different responses
*** Why a multistep pathway?
    - Multiple levels of regulation
    - Amplification of the signal
    - Pathways can intersect
      - Different cellular responses depending on combinations of signals
*** Complex Networks
    #+CAPTION: Complex Networks
    [[file:./Week 8/complexnetworks.png]]
*** Take Home Message
    - Signal is transduced from the receptor to cause a response.
      - Kinase cascades
      - Secondary messengers
    - Response
      - Affect activity of enzyme (cytoplasmic response)
      - Affect amount of enzyme (nuclear response)
*** Key Concepts in Cell Communication
    - Ligand binding
    - Cascades of interactions
    - Protein Phosphorylation
    - Response Specificity
** OB010.8.L4 - Cell Signaling in Action

*** Apoptosis
    - Programmed cell death
    - Initiated in cells that are
      - Infected
      - Damaged
      - No longer functional or required
    #+CAPTION: Apoptosis
    [[file:./Week 8/apoptosis.png]]
    - Allows body to recycle cellular components
      - Genome is fragmented
      - Organelles are disassembled
      - Cell breaks apart into smaller vesicles through "blebbing"
      - Vesicles are cleaned up by scavenger cells

*** Development
    - In a multicellular organism, cells must coordinate to form a functional organism
    - Cells can *induce* their neighbors to become a specialized cell type (*differentiate*)

** OB010.9.L1 - Cell Cycle
*** In this lecture...
    - /Omnis cellula e cellula/
      - Every cell from a cell
      - One cell divides into two cells
*** Cell Division
    - One cell divides into two
    - Genetically identical daughter cells
    - Very complicated orchestration of events
    - Very tightly regulated
    - When a single unicellular organism goes through cell division, it becomes two complete organisms
      #+CAPTION: Reproduction
      [[file:./Week 9/amoebareproduction.png]]
    - Most multicellular organisms start as a single cell
    - There are some plants that can just "chop off a limb" which grows into a new organism
      #+CAPTION: Growth and Development
      [[file:./Week 9/growthanddevelopment.png]]
    - Cells in a multicellular organism need to be replaced as they get old and worn-out
      #+CAPTION: Tissue Renewal
      [[file:./Week 9/tissuerenewal.png]]
*** The Cell Cycle
    - Mitotic Phase - cell division
    - Interphase - not cell division (or preparing for division)
    #+CAPTION: Cell Cycle
    [[file:./Week 9/cellcycle.png]]
**** Interphase
     - G1 phase = First Gap
       - Cell sort of cihllin'
       - What we normally think of
     - S phase = Synthesis
       - DNA is replicated
     - G2 phase = Second Gap
       - Cell makes sure all systems are "go"
**** Mitotic Phase
     - Mitosis - Division of the duplicated DNA
     - Cytokinesis - Division of the cytoplasm and its contents
       - Division of everything else, organelles
       - Less carefully orchestrated because it doesn't really matter if the two cells have exactly the same number of mitochondria
	 - You can always make more mitochondria
     - Mitosis and Cytokinesis overlap in time
*** How long does it take?
    - In human cells...
      - Mitotic Phase ~1 hour
      - S Phase ~10-12 hours
      - G2 Phase ~4-6 hours
      - G1 Phase is variable
    - Different cell types divide at different rates due to the length of the G1 phase
      - Neurons rarely divide
      - Cells lining the intestines divide rapidly
*** Key Players
    - The Cytoskeleton
      - Microtubules
	#+CAPTION: Microtubules
	[[file:./Week 9/microtubules.png]]
	- Hollow tube
	- Molecular Highway
	- Radiating out just outside the nucleus
      - Actin
	#+CAPTION: Actin Filaments
	[[file:./Week 9/actinfilaments.png]]
	- Thinnest filaments
      - This is what the cytoskeleton looks like in G1, looks completely different in other stages.
    - The Chromosomes
      #+CAPTION: Chromosomes
      [[file:./Week 9/chromosomes.png]]
      - DNA replication and organization
      - The nucleus
      - All of the chromosomes are duplicated during S phase
      - The chromosomes condense during mitosis so that they can be easily distributed between the two new cells
      - centromeres are important
*** Take Home Message
    - Cell cycle divided into
      - G1 phase
      - S phase
      - G2 phase
      - Mitotic phase
    - Lots of checks and balances
    - We're going to talk a llot about what happens to the DNA and cytoskeleton

    - In Eukaryotes and Prokaryotes
*** The Phases of Mitosis
    - Mitosis
      1. Prophase
      2. Prometaphase
      3. Metaphase
      4. Anaphase
      5. Telophase
    - Remember Mitosis is one continuous, seamless process, not discrete steps
    - I P on the M A T
      - Interphase, Prophase, Metaphase, Anaphase, Telophase
*** G2 of Interphase
    - DNA has been replicated
    - Centrosomes have been replicated
    - Everything is still intact
    #+CAPTION: G2 of Interphase
    [[file:./Week 9/g2ofinterphase.png]]
    - Blue = DNA
    - Green = Microtubules
    - Red = Intermediate Filaments
*** Prophase
    - Chromosomes begin condensing
    - Centrosomes move apart and spindle (composed of microtubules) begins to assemble
    #+CAPTION: Prophase
    [[file:./Week 9/prophase1617.png]]
*** Prometaphase
    - Nuclear envelope breaks apart
    - Chromosomes continue to condense
    - Centrosomes move to opposite sides of the cell
    - Spindle attaches to kinetochore on chrosomes
    #+CAPTION: Prometaphase
    [[file:./Week 9/prometaphase_163514.png]]
*** Chromosomes
    - Centromere - construction in roughly the center of chromosomes (feature of the DNA)
    - Kinetochore - protein scaffold that assembles at the centromere to allow attachment to the spindle
    #+CAPTION: Chromosomes
    [[file:./Week 9/chromosomes.png]]
*** Mitotic Spindle
    #+CAPTION: Extreme Close-up of a Centromere
    [[file:./Week 9/closeupcentromere_165250.png]]
*** Metaphase
    - Microtubules tug at chromosomes until they line up in the middle (the metaphase plate)
    - Spindle is completely formed and centrosomes are opposite each other
    #+CAPTION: Metaphase
    [[file:./Week 9/metaphase_170623.png]]
*** Anaphase
    - Sister chromatids let go of each other and the chromosomes move to opposite poles
    - Centrosomes separate as microtubules from opposite sides push against each other
    #+CAPTION: Anaphase
    [[file:./Week 9/anaphase_170716.png]]
**** More Detailed
     - Motor proteins in the kinetochore pull chromosomes towards the poles along with spindle
     - Microtubule depolymerizes at the kinetochore
     - Motor proteins attached to nonkinetochore microtubules push the poles further apart
     #+CAPTION: Anaphase in Detail
     [[file:./Week 9/anaphaseindetail_171025.png]]
*** Telophase
    - Nuclear envelope reforms
    - Chromosomes decondense
    - Spindle falls apart
    - Cytokinesis begins
    #+CAPTION: Telophase
    [[file:./Week 9/telophase_171235.png]]
*** Cytokinesis in Animal Cells
    - Cleavage produces two daughter cells
    - Ring of actin filaments forms under the plasma membrane at the metaphase plate
    - Ring contrats due to the motor protein myosin
    #+CAPTION: Cytokinesis in Animal Cells
    [[file:./Week 9/cytokinesisanimalcells_175945.png]]
*** Cytokinesis in Plant Cells
    - Plant have cell walls
    - Vesicles containing cell wall components (cellulose!) move along microtubules towards the metaphase plate.
    - Vesicles fuse causing formation of the cell plate.
    - Cell plate divides cell into two daughter cells

**** M Phase in Plants
     #+CAPTION: M Phase in Plants
     [[file:./Week 9/mphaseplants_180237.png]]
*** Cell Cycle in Prokaryotes
    - Prokaryotes do not have a nucleus or cytoskeleton
    - Prokaryotes replicate by binary fission ("Division in half")
*** Binary Fission in Prokaryotes
    - Origin of replication is near plasma membrane
    - As DNA replicates
      - the two origins move to opposite sides of the cell
      - the cell elongates
    #+CAPTION: Binary Fission in Prokaryotes
    [[file:./Week 9/binaryfission_180631.png]]
    - When DNA has finished replicating and the origins are attached to opposite poles, the cell pinches into two

*** Key Terms
** OB010.9.L3
*** In this lecture...
    - Control of the cell cycle
    - Refer back to Cell Cycle figure
*** Varying the Rate of Division
    - Intestinal cells :: constantly divide to generate new lining of the intestines
    - Skin cells :: vary rate of division to maintain thickness of skin :: 
    - Liver cells :: don't divide unless the liver is damaged
    - Neurons :: don't divide even when brain is damaged
*** Cell Cycle Control System
    - Internal Control
      - Can I divide?
    - External Control
      - Should I divide?
    #+CAPTION: Cell Cycle Control System
    [[file:./Week 9/cellcyclecontrolsystem_182442.png]]
*** Checkpoints
    - A necessary stop point
    - Must be overridden by "go" signals
    - "Go" signal comes from cellular surveillance mechanisms
    #+CAPTION: Checkpoints
    [[file:./Week 9/checkpoints_182543.png]]
    - You get stuck in G1 if the checkpoint isn't passed
*** G1 Checkpoint
    - Prevents S Phase until "Go" signals are received
    - "Go" signals include...
      - External signals - /Should/ I divide?
	- Are the proper nutrients available?
	- Are growth factors present?
	- Is there enough space to divide? (density-dependent inhibition)
	- Am I on solid ground? (anchorage dependence)
	  - Not all cell types
**** Growth Factors
     - A protein outside of the cell that stimulates the cell to divide
     #+CAPTION: Growth Factors
     [[file:./Week 9/growthfactors_182951.png]]
*** G2 Checkpoint
    - Prevents M Phase until "Go" signals are received
    - "Go" signals include...
      - Is the cell big enough?
      - Has the DNA been replicated?
      - Have the centrosomes been replicated?
*** M Phase Checkpoint
    - Prevents Anaphase until "Go" signals are received
    - "Go" signals include...
      - Are all of the chromosomes lined up at the metaphase plate?

*** Cytomplasmic Signals
    - There are molecular signals that induce the different phases of the cell cycle
    #+CAPTION: Cytoplasmic Signals
    [[file:./Week 9/cytoplasmicsignals_183636.png]]
*** Molecular Control of the Cell Cycle 
    - A certain group of kinases allow the cell to move past checkpoints
    - These kinases are only active when bound to cyclins
    - Kinases are Cyclin Dependent Kinases (cdks)
    #+CAPTION: Molecular Control of the Cell Cycle
    [[file:./Week 9/molecularcontrol_184044.png]]
    - Cdks are always present
    - Cyclins cycle
    - Active cdk/cyclin complex involved in the G2 checkpoint is called Mitosis Promoting Factor (MPF)
*** Take home message
    - The cell cycle pauses at the boundary between G1 and S, G2 and M, and Metaphase and Anaphase to make sure everything is good to go
    - The cell cycle is controlled by external and internal signals
    - Cyclins (whose levels oscillate) and cdks (which require cyclins to be active) are the molecular switches at the checkpoints
** OB010.9.L4 - Cancer

    - Malignant tumor
      - Cancer
*** Cancer
    - Lose control of the cell cycle
    - Dedifferentiate
      - Lose the properties of normal cells in the tissue
    - Invasive
      - Will leave site of original tumor
    - Immortal
      - Some tumor cells express telomerase
      - HeLa cells
    #+CAPTION: Cancer Progression
    - [[file:./Week 9/cancerprogression_184913.png]]
      - Metastasis :: tumor cells leave the original tumor and become multiple tumors throughout the body
*** Cell Cycle Control System
    - Internal Control
      - Can I divide?
    - External Control
      - Should I divide?
      - Cancer cells have gone haywire, stops asking questions and just divides
*** Unregulated Cell Division
    - Cancer cells do not respond to normal external cues
      - Are the proper nutrients available?
      - Are growth factors present?
      - Is there enough space to divide? (density-dependent inhibition)
      - Am I on solid ground? (anchorage dependence)
    - Doesn't care if there's space, doesn't care if it's on solid ground
*** Anchorage and Density Independent
    #+CAPTION: Normal Mammalian Cells vs Cancer Cells
    [[file:./Week 9/nmcVScancer_185415.png]]
*** Transformation
    - When a normal cell turns cancerous
    - Mutation of genes involved in cell cycle regulation
    - Genes involved in cell cycle regulation fit into one of two categories
      - Tumor-suppressor genes
      - Oncogenes
*** Regulation is lost in cancer
    - Break the checkpoint
      - Go past checkpoint whether the "Go" signals are present or not
      - Ignore the Stop signs (Remove inhibition)
    - Break the "Go" signal
      - Surveillance mechanism acts as if cues are always present
      - OR Surveillance mechanism is function but the cue is always present
      - Go signal is permanently "on" (constantly stimulate)
*** Ignoring the Stop signs
    - Tumor-suppressor Genes
    - Normal product of tumor-suppressor genes /inhibit/ the cell cycle
    - When gene is mutated, you remove the inhibition
    - Examples include genes involved in
      - the checkpoints
      - cell density surveillance
      - DNA repair and mutation surveillance
*** Go Signal stuck on
    - Proto-oncogenes
    - Normal product of proto-oncogenes /active/ the cell cycle
    - When gene is mutated...
      - It is called an Oncogene
      - Produces a "Go" signal that is always on

    - Meiosis
*** In this lecture...
    - Genetic Diversity in a Sexual Reproduction Life Cycle
    - Stages of Meiosis
*** Overview of Meiosis
    - A reduction division
      - Number of chromosomes is halved
    - Results in 4 cells that are not genetically identical
    #+CAPTION: Labeled Overview of Meiosis

*** Meiosis Generates Genetic Diversity
    #+CAPTION: Meiosis Generates Genetic Diversity
    [[file:./Week 10/meiosisgeneticdiversity_205048.png]]
    - 23 chromosomes => tons of different combinations
*** The Stages of Meiosis
    - Meiosis I and Meiosis II are each made of
      - Prophase
      - Metaphase
      - Anaphase
      - Telophase
*** Prophase I
    - Homologous chromosomes find each other
      - Different from Mitosis, Mitosis, spindle
      - Perfectly aligned together, cut DNA, switch arms
    - Crossing over occurs
    #+CAPTION: Prophase I
    [[file:./Week 10/prophaseI_205800.png]]
    - The most important phase in meiosis
    - Spending the most time in prophase I
    #+CAPTION: Crossing Over
    [[file:./Week 10/crossing_over_210640.png]]
    - Electron micrograph of a tetrad undergoing the crossing over (on the right of this figure)
    - Non-sister chromatids are going to cross over
    - Greater genetic diversity in the daughter cells
    - crossing over occurs at a random spot on the chromosome
      - Chromosomes are cut at the exact same place as their partners are
      - The cuts are not always at the same place (though the pairs always match)
    - in humans, crossing over happens 1-3 spots per chromosome
*** The Rest of Meiosis I
    #+CAPTION: The Rest of Meiosis
    [[file:./Week 10/restofmeiosis_211107.png]]
    - Metaphase
    - homologous chromosomes are going to attatch to the spindle
    - one homologus chromosome is going to attatch to the north pole, south pole (not sister chromatids like mitosis)
*** Meiosis II
    #+CAPTION: Meiosis II
    [[file:./Week 10/meiosisII_211309.png]]
    - Prophase II
    - Metaphase II
    - Anaphase II

    [[file:./Week 10/comparingmm_211505.png]]
    - Difference in Metaphase and Metaphase I (sister chromatids, homologous chromosomes)
*** Origins of Genetic Diversity
    - Mutation
    - Sexual Reproduction Only
      - Independent Assortment of Chromosomes
	- Approximately 8 million ways of splitting 23 maternal and 23 paternal chromosomes during Meiosis I
      - Crossing Over
	- Produces recombinant chromosomes (tons of ways you can mix up the maternal and paternal chromosomes)
      - Random Fertilization
	- 8+ million cobinations * 2 (1 egg, 1 sperm)
*** Take Home Message
    - Meiosis is a type of cell division that halves the number of chromosomes and produces cells that are not identical
    - In Meiosis I, homologous chromosomes are separated producing haploid daughter cells

** OB010.10.L2 - Genetic Diversity
*** In this lecture...
    - 2 key processes to propagation of a species
      - Reproduction
      - Generation of genetic diversity
    - Modes of reproduction
*** Continuity and Change
    - Like produces like. (Reproduction)
      - Offspring are the same species and share their parents' characteristics
      - On a gross scale
      - Producing more of a species
    - Variation
      - Offspring are not exact duplicates of their parents
      - Genetic diversity is important for the health of a species
	- Royalty only breeding into royalty
	- Led to bad health, inherited diseases
    - these two things ^ are the most important things in keeping a species alive
    - Genetics is the study of heredity and hereditary variation
*** Life Cycles
    - All life cycles require a process for reproduction, and a process to inroduce genetic diversity
    - Asexual reproduction
      - Does not introduce genetic diversity
      - Produces exact copies - "clones"
      - Most unicellular organisms and some multicellular
    - Sexual reproduction
      - "Mom and dad"
      - Some unicellular and most multicellular organisms
*** Asexual Reproduction
    - One parent produces offspring by mitosis
    #+CAPTION: Asexual Reproduction
    [[file:./Week 10/asexualreproduction_213321.png]]
    - Binary Fission
      - Process of cell division
    - Budding
      - A hydra, multicellular organism that can reproduce by budding
*** Sexual Reproduction
    - Accomplish 2 processes at once!
      - Reproduction
      - Generate genetic diversity
    - 2 parents
    - One cell from each parent combine together (fuse).
      - But wait... Wouldn't that double the number of chromosomes?
*** Sexual Reproduction and Chromosome Number
    - Parents need to half the amount of DNA in a special set of cells to prepare for reproduction
      - Meiosis - special cell division that cuts the number of chromosomes in half
      - Produces gametes (sperm and egg)
    #+CAPTION: Sexual Reproduction and Chromosome Number
    [[file:./Week 10/sexualreproduction_chromosomenumber_213703.png]]
    - Gametes are haploid
      - haploid :: One set of chromosomes
    - All other cells (somatic cells) are diploid
      - diploid :: two sets of chromosomes
    - Humans have 2 sets of 23 chromosomes, 2 sets of identical chromosomes
    - A gamete from each parent fuse together (fertilization) to produce a zygote with the full complement of chromosomes
    - Zygote divides mitotically to produce the adult
*** The Human Karyotype
    - Ordered display of chromosomes
    - Chromosomes are visible for karyotyping during mitosis
    #+CAPTION: The Human Karyotype
    [[file:./Week 10/humankaryotype_214009.png]]
    - 2 full sets of chromosomes
      - one from mom
      - one from dad
    - Each set is 23 chromosomes
      - 22 autosomes (same in all sexes)
      - 1 sex chromosome
	- XX = female
	- XY = male

    - Meiosis and fertilization always alternate
    - Diploid and haploid cells can do mitosis
    - Only diploid cells can do meiosis

** OB010.11.L1
*** In this lecture...
    - How traits are inherited
    - The first geneticist - Gregor Mendel
*** What we've learned so far:
    - Most of your traits are either identical to your mom's or dad's, not a blend of the two
      - Some characteristics from both
    - your (somatic) cells are diploid
      - two copies of every gene
      - one from mom and one from dad
    - Your parents made haploid gametes by meiosis. Each gamete contains one copy of every gene
*** The Father of Modern Genetics
    - Gregor Mendel - monk
    - Studied the inheritance of traits in pea plants
    - Did his research /way/ before anyone had discovered chromosomes or genes
*** To study inheritance...
    - Must be able to observe/measure the characteristic
    - Must do crosses
      - A cross is a mating between known parents
      - Observe characteristics in offspring and compare to parents
      - Parents are the P generation
      - The first generation of offspring is F1
*** Why pea plants?
    - Easily scored characteristics
    #+CAPTION: Easily Scored Categories
    [[file:./Week 11/scoredcharacteristics_204140.png]]
    - Easy to cross
    - Stamens are the male reproductive organs in plants
    - Carpels are the female reproductive organs in plants
    - Pea plants are normally hermaphrodites and can self-fertilize
    #+CAPTION: Crossing Pea Plants
    [[file:./Week 11/crossingpeaplants_204255.png]]
*** Mendel's Experiments
    - Chose true-breeding parents to cross-pollinate
      - If parent self-pollinates, all offspring are identical to the parent
    - After cross-pollination, all plants in the F1 generation had purple flowers
    #+CAPTION: True Breeding Parents
    [[file:./Week 11/truebreadingparents_204529.png]]
**** That's not all
     - Allowed F1 generation to self-pollinate
     - 75% of F2 generation had purple flowers and 25% had white flowers
     - The "white flower" trait skipped a generation!
     #+CAPTION: F2 Generation
     [[file:./Week 11/f2generation_204816.png]]
*** Dominant vs. Recessive
    - White flower trait didn't disappear in the F1 generation otherwise all plants in the F2 generation would be purple
    - White flower trait was "hiding" in the F1 generation
    - Purple flowers are dominant
    - White flowers are recessive
**** Not just flower color...
     #+CAPTION: Mendel studied thousands of plants
     [[file:./Week 11/mendeltraits_205054.png]]
*** Why different colored flowers?
    - Alternative versions of genes account for variations in an inherited characteristic
    - Alternative versions called /alleles/
    - "Purple" allele = dominant allele
    - "White" allele = recessive allele
    #+CAPTION: Dominant and Recessive Alleles
    [[file:./Week 11/dominantrecessivealleles_205507.png]]
    - For each characteristic, an organism inherets two alleles, one from each parent.
    - If the two alleles differ, the dominant allele determines the organism's appearance and the recessive allele has no effect
*** Phenotype vs Genotype
    - Phenotype :: the displayed trait
    - Genotype :: the actual alleles the organism possesses
    #+CAPTION: Genotype vs Phenotype
    [[file:./Week 11/phenotypegenotype_205709.png]]
*** Denoting Genotype
    - Capital Letter = dominant
    - Small Letter = recessive
    - Homozygous
      - 2 copies of the same allele
    - Heterozygous
      - 2 different alleles
*** Mendel's Law of Segregation
    - Mendel's Law of Segregation :: The two alleles for a heritable characteristic separate (segregate) during gamete formation and end up in different gametes
    #+CAPTION: Mendel's Law of Segregation
    [[file:./Week 11/lawofsegregation_210021.png]]
*** Applying these concepts
    - If a true breeding plant produces purple flowers, the white allele isn't "hiding" in the genotype
      - Genotype = PP
    - If a true breeding plant produces white flowers, it has no dominant allele
      - Genotype = pp
    #+CAPTION: P Generation
    [[file:./Week 11/Pgeneration_210133.png]]
*** Punnett Squares
    - All gametes of the purple parent must have a P allele
    - All gametes of the white parent must have a p allele
    - A Punnett square lets you determine all possible combinations of gametes
    #+CAPTION: Punnett Square
    [[file:./Week 11/punnet_square_210311.png]]
*** Take Home Message
    - Dominant and recessive traits
    - Phenotype and genotype
    - Alleles = variations of a gene
    - If an organism has 2 copies of a gene, it is homozygous or heterozygous
    - If you cross two heterozygotes, offspring have
      - Phenotype ratio = 3:1 (dom:rec)
      - Genotype ration = 1:2:1 (homo dom:hetero:homo rec)

       #+CAPTION: Test-cross
       [[file:./Week 11/testcross_211209.png]]
     - self-fertilization only works with organisms that can fertilize themselves
     - test-cross is useful in labs where you are doing genetics with other organisms
   - Brown eyes are a dominant allele, blue eyes are a recessive allele
     - B, b
     - Crossing of a person with brown eyes and blue eyes
       |   | b        | b        |

   #+CAPTION: Monohybrids
   [[file:./Week 11/monohybrids_212010.png]]
   - F1 generation are monohybrids
     - Heterozygous for one characteristic
     - "Monohybrid cross" is a cross between two monohybrids
   - An organism heterozygous for two characteristics are dihybrids
   #+CAPTION: Dihybrids

   - Probability
     - Each flip of a coin is an independent event
     - Each fertilization event is an independent event
       - Having 4 offspring does not mean you will have 3 with the dominant trait and 1 with the recessive trait
   - It is useful to be able to answer genetics probability questions without drawing Punnett squares
     - "What is the probability that two parents with brown eyes and genotype Bb have a child with blue eyes?"
       - 50% chance of getting b allele from mom
       - 50% chance of getting b allele from dad
       - 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/5 (25% chance)
   - Rule of Multiplication
     - The probability of two independent events happening
       - Multiple probability of individual events
     - Because of the Law of Independent Assortment, we can apply the Rule of Multiplication to calculate the probability of having multiple traits
     - *EXAMPLE*
       - Cross: YyRr x YyRr
       - Probability of green, wrinkled seeds?
	 - Chance of green seeds? 1/4
	 - Chance of wrinkled seeds? 1/4
	 - Chance of both? 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16
       - Probability of green, round seeds?
	 - 1/4 (green) x 3/4 (round) = 3/16
       - Probability of yellow, wrinkled seeds?
	 - 3/4 (yellow) x 1/4 (wrinkled) = 3/16
       - Probability of yellow, round seeds?
	 - 3/4 (yellow) x 3/4 (round) = 9/16
   - Take Home Message
     - Test-cross - determines the genotype of the parents by looking at the phenotypes of the offspring
     - Mendel's Law of Independent Assortment
     - Using probabilities to answer genetics problems
       - Most useful ratios to remember
	 - Monohybrid cross = phenotype 3:1 (dom:rec)
	 - Monohybrid cross = genotype 1:2:1 (DD:Dd:dd)
       - Rule of Multiplication
	 - If two events are independent, you can calculate the probability of a particular result by multiplying the probability of the individual results.
** W11D1
   - Chi-squared, at a given value df, determines P value
     - x^2 = SUM[(observed-expected)^2/(expected)]
   - DF = (number of expected outcomes) - 1
   - If the number is greater than critical value, then null hypothesis is rejected
   - Lab DF is 3 because 4 phenotypes

** OB010.11.L3 - Complex Inheritence
   - In this lecture:
     - Some characteristics do not follow the model of Mendelian genetics
     - Complex Patterns of Inheritance
   - Mendelian Genetics
     - Law of Segregation
     - Law of Independent Assortment
     - Both laws assume
       - One characteristic = one gene
       - Two alleles - one dominant, one recessive
       - will show *these don't always hold true*
   - Complex Inheritance
     - Sometimes alleles are not 100% dominant or recessive
       - Codominance
       - Incomplete Dominance
     - Sometimes one gene affects multiple characteristics
     - Often one characteristic is affected by multiple genes
       - Epistasis
   - Complete Dominance
     - All of Mendel's pea plant characteristics
     - Either or states
   - Codominance
     - Two alleles both affect the phenotype in separate, distinguishable ways
     - Example: Human Blood Type
       - Type A, B, AB, or O
       - The Blood Type Gene (I) encodes for an enzyme that attaches carbohydrate groups to the cell-surface proteins on red blood cells (RBCs).
       - 2 dominant alleles
	 - I^{A} causes Carbohydrate A to be on the cell surface
	 - I^{B} causes Carbohydrate B to be on the cell surface
       - 1 recessive allele
	 - i encodes for a defective enzyme that cannot link carbohydrates to cell-surface proteins
       #+CAPTION: Codominance in Blood Types
       [[file:./Week 11/bloodtypes_234145.png]]
       - AA, BB, OO, AB, AO, BO
   - Incomplete Dominance
     #+CAPTION: Incomplete Dominance
     [[file:./Week 11/dragonflowerid_234334.png]]
     - Two alleles both affect the phenotype in a blended manner
     - 1:2:1 ratio phenotype, rather than 3:1
   - Epistasis
     - One gene affects the phenotypic expression of another gene
     - Example: If a person is bald, it doesn't matter what their genotype for hair color is
     - Example:
       #+CAPTION: Epistasis Hair Color
       [[file:./Week 11/epistasishair_234639.png]]
       - B = black hair
       - b = brown hair

** OB010.11.L4 - Non Mendelian Inheritance
   - In this lecture:
     - Are there heritable traits that are not subject to Mendelian inheritance?
   - Looking back to chromosomal basis of inheritance
   - Extragenomic DNA
     - Some genes reside outside of the nucleus
       - Mitochondria
       - Chloroplasts
       - Plastids
     - Since the DNA is outside nucleus, and the usual chromosomes are not segregated through the meiotic process
       - What rules do these genes follow for inheritance?
	 - Still must be inherited through gametes
	 - In most sexually reproducing plants and animals, organelles are inherited through the mother
     - Example:
       - Leber's Hereditary Optic Neuropathy
	 - An inherited disorder in which specific cells in the retina degenerate
	 - Due to one of four point mutations in proteins important for oxidative phosphorylation
	 - Since these proteins are encoded by genes found in the mitochondrial DNA, the disorder can only be inherited maternally
   - The DNA code is more than we think
     #+CAPTION: More than we think
     [[file:./Week 11/methyltransferase_235535.png]]
     - Cytosine bases can be methylated, adding an extra layer of information
       - Methylation leads to tighter packaging of DNA, leading to silencing of genes
   - Epigenetics
     - When DNA is replicated, the pattern of methylation is reproduced on the daughter strand
     - If an allele is methylated in the parent's gametes, it will also be in the offspring.
       - Each parent can have different patterns of methylation
       - The expression of an allele can depend on who it was inherited from
       - Example:
	 #+CAPTION: Epigenetics in AS/PWS
	 [[file:./Week 11/epigeneticsexample_235804.png]]
	 - AS/PWS critical region on chromosome 15
	   - For a variety of genes one allele (maternal or paternal) is silenced and the other is expressed
	   - Pattern is specific
	 - Partial deletion of chromosome 15
	   - Produces Angelman syndrome *(AS)* if inherited from the mother
	     - Intellectual and developmental disability
	     - Seizures
	     - Happy demeanor
	   - Produces Prader-Willi syndrome *(PWS)* if inherited from the father
	     - Low muscle tone and short stature
	     - Incomplete sexual development
	     - Cognitive disabilities

*** Notes
    - Wait a minute... if the genes are on the same chromosome? Can Mendel's law of indepdent assortment apply?
    - Chromosomal Basis of Inheritance
      - Refer to diagram in previous lectures
    - Mendel got lucky
      - Looked at seven characteristics, and pea plants happen to hav etwo sets of seven chromosomes
      - chromosomes have hundreds to thousands of genes on them, some must be inherited together
      - Genes that are inherited together are *linked*
    - Breaking the Law (of IA)
      - If there is a gene on the same chromosome as R, then they will end up on the same gamete
    - Crossing over plays a role
      - Genes on the same chromosome don't /have/ to end up on the same gamete
      - Crossing over occurs in Prophase I
	- random place along the chromosome
	#+CAPTION: Crossing Over in Prophase I
	[[file:./Week 12/crossingoverprophaseI_224049.png]]
    - What about the 1:1:1:1 ratio?
      #+CAPTION: Example using True Breeding Flies
      [[file:./Week 12/treebreedingflies_224257.png]]
      - Normally:
	- dihybrid x double homozygous recessive
	- would be equally probably
      - Are not equally probably because short body gene is on the same chromosome as the black body gene
    - Linked Genes
      - Phenotypes of parents are over-rppresented in the offspring
      - parental-type offspring :: represent parents
      - recombinant (non parental-type) offspring :: a mix of the parents' traits
    - Recombinant Chromosomes
      #+CAPTION: Recombinant Chromosomes
      [[file:./Week 12/recombinantchromosomes_224921.png]]
    - Crossing over is random
      - Crossing over doesn't always happen between the two genes
      - Parental phenotypes are always favored
	- crossing over does not occour in between the two genes => parental-type
	- crossing over does occur in between two genes => recombinant
    - Recombination frequency
      - recombination frequency will be different based on the distance between the genes
      - further apart, more likely crossing over will occur in between => greater number of recombinants
      - Recombination frequency = $\frac{391}{2300} \cdot 100 = 17%$
    - Mapping Genes
      - Use frequency of recombination to map genes
      - farther apart the genes are => larger recombination frequency
      - Largest distance?
	- normally, 25% all around, 1:1:1:1
	- parental-type would then be 50%
	- largest distance is 50% because you can never favor recombinants
    - 
*** Cues
    - Largest distance you can map using recombination frequency to map genes?
*** Summary
    - Some genes are linked together and do not follow Mendel's law of IA
    - Sometimes, crossing over occurs between linked genes, creating recombinants
    - Parental phenotypes are /always/ favored
    - Frequency of recombinants can be used to map the genes
      - Linkage map
** OB010.12.L2 - Linkage, Part 2
*** Notes
    - In this lecture
      - Inheritance of genes on the sex chromosomes
    - Thomas Hunt Morgan, studied inheritance in /Drosophila melanogaster/ (fruitflies)
      - Difference in eye color, white vs red
      - Crossed a red-eyed female with a white-eyed male
      - F1 generation all had red eyes
	- red is dominant
      - Monohybrid cross
	- Produced 3:1 phenotypic ratio
	- But:
	  - all females have red eyes
	  - 1/2 males have red, 1/2 males have white
      - Gene for eye color is on the X chromosome
      - Males have *hemizygous* for genes on X
	- Have only one allele
      #+CAPTION: Morgan's Fruitflies - 7 min
      [[file:./Week 12/morganfruitfly_230222.png]]
    - Sex Determination
      - Females are XX
      - Males are XY
      - X and Y chromosomes are partially homologous so that they pair up in meiosis
      #+CAPTION: Sex Determination
      [[file:./Week 12/sexdetermination_230520.png]]
    - Other ways to determine sex
      - The X-O system
	- Female = XX
	- Male = X
      - The Z-W system
	- Female = ZW
	- Male = ZZ
	- use Z and W to not confuse with X and Y
      - The haplo-diploid system
	- Female = from fertilized eggs
	- Male = from unfertilized eggs
    - Sex-linked Genes
      - X chromosome has many genes unrelated to sex determination
      - Genes on sex chromosomes are sex-linked (also known as X-linked, same thing)
	- Characteristic and the sex of animal are linked
      - more commonly refers to genes on the X that do not determine sex
    - Patterns of Inheritance
      - The father determins the sex of the offspring
      - Males are hemizygous for X-linked genes
      #+CAPTION: Patterns of Inheritance: Fruitfly Eye Color
      [[file:./Week 12/genotypesforXY_231131.png]]
    - Sex-linked Characteristics
      - Some examples of disorders are more common in males but can happen in females
	- Color blindness
	- Hair loss
	  - rip us men
	- Duchenne muscular dystrophy
	- Hemophilia
    - Sex-linkage in Pedigree
      #+CAPTION: Sex-linkage in a Pedigree
      [[file:./Week 12/sexlinkage_231537.png]]
      - Only males are affected, mothers are only carriers
    - X inactivation
      - if some genes on X are not involved in sex determination, do females have a "double dose" of those genes?
      - No - females inactivate one X chromosomes - "Dosage compensation"
	- Occurs early in development
	- Occurs randomly in each cell
	- X chromosome condenses and becomes Barr body
	  - Barr body, condensed and inactive X chromosome; shows as black dot in nucleus
	- Generates a "mosaic"
      - Example
	#+CAPTION: Example using Cat Fur
	[[file:./Week 12/catfurexample_231933.png]]
	- Completely random, some fur gets black, some fur gets orange
	- 
*** Cues
    - sex-linked characteristics
    - Sex determination
*** Summary
    - Genes on the sex chromosomes are sex-linked
    - Males are predominantly affected by sex-linked disorders because they are hemizygous for these genes
    - Females inactivate one X chromosome so males and females have the same "dosage" of sex-linked genes

** OB010.12.L3 - DNA as Genetic Material
*** Notes
    - Macromolucule that serves as genetic material is either protein or DNA
      - Protein
	- 20 amino acids
      - DNA
	- 4 nucleotides
	- DNA was, at the time, known to be structured in a tetronucleotide
    - Experiments that discovered DNA as the genetic material
      - Pneumonia
	- Pneumonia caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae
	- Frederick Griffith hoped to create a vaccine
	- Studied two strains of the bacteria
	  - Smooth (causes pneumonia)
	  - Rough (no health impact)
	- Rough bacteria transformed to smooth
	  #+CAPTION: Vaccines
	  [[file:./Week 12/vaccinebacteria_225531.png]]
	  - Last column shows rough bacteria changing to smooth
      - Cell Extracts
	- Avery, McCarty, and McLeod
	- 1944
	- removed protein, lipid, carbohydrates
	- remaining sample caused transformation
	- "DNA causes transformation"
	- Took the sample that was able to cause transformation
	  - degraded RNA -> transformation
	  - degraded protein -> transformation
	  - degraded DNA -> no transformation
      - Conclusive Evidence: Experiments with Viruses
	- Viruses transfer genetic information to a host
	- viruses change cellular activity
	- had to find which macromolecule they send to the host
	- Radioactivity tracks macromolecules
	  - used radioactivity to mark the cells
	  - like a GPS tracker, indicator of where the macromolecule is
	- radioactive viruses function normally
	- blender (literally a blender) separates viruses from cells
	- experiment showed that viruses injected radioactive DNA from the cells
    - What does DNA then look like?
      - now DNA is known to be the genetic material

** OB010.12.L4 - DNA Replication
*** Notes
    - In this lecture
      - How to make an exact copy of the DNA genome
      - How is DNA replicated?
      - S phase of the cell cycle
    - Replication of a Human Genome
      - Human Genome is ~6 billion bases
      - S Phase takse 10-12 hours
      - One error in 10 billion nucleotides
    - Replication is Semi-conservative
      - Each strand of the dsDNA is used as a template to make a new complementary strade
      - Results in two identical dsDNA molecules
      #+CAPTION: Semi-Conservative
      [[file:./Week 12/semiconservativereplication_231915.png]]
    - Steps of DNA Replication
      1) replication initiation
	 - strands unwind beginning at the origin of replication
	   - Eukarotic replication
	     #+CAPTION: Eukaryotic Replication: Origins
	     [[file:./Week 12/eukaryoticreplication_origins_232211.png]]
	     - bidirectional
	   - Prokaryotic Replication
	     - One circular chromosome
	     - One origin of replication
	     - genetically identical daughter chromosomes
	 - DNA replication begins with the addition of an RNA primer by the enzyme Primase
	 #+CAPTION: Addition of RNA to primer
	 [[file:./Week 12/additionofrna_232105.png]]
      2) Replication Elongation
	 - In *prokaryotes*, DNA polymerates ("pol") III builds DNA off of the primer, 5' -> 3', complementary to the template strand
	 #+CAPTION: Prokaryote Polymerates
	 [[file:./Week 12/dnaprokaryote_232618.png]]
	 - Adding Nucleosides
	   #+CAPTION: Adding Nucleosides
	   [[file:./Week 12/addingnucleosides_232827.png]]
	 - Reconciling two facts
	   - can only add nucleotides in one direction
	   - but it's still bidirectional?
	   - anti parallel
	   - lagging strands are not continuously built
	   #+CAPTION: Reconciling
	   [[file:./Week 12/reconciling_233341.png]]
      3) Replication Termination
	 - Anytime it bumps into another fragment, it hits an RNA primer, gets rid of the RNA
	 #+CAPTION: Replication Termination
	 [[file:./Week 12/replicationtermination_233517.png]]
      4) Linking the fragments together
	 - DNA ligase glues the fragments together to make a continuous DNA polymer

    - The Big Picture
      #+CAPTION: The Big Picture
      [[file:./Week 12/bigpicture_233631.png]]
    - What happens at the ends?
      - DNA replication requires an RNA primer
      - At the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes (telomeres), a short amount of DNA is lost during each round of replication
      - not a problem over generations because telomerase builds telomeres in sperm and egg genomes
      #+CAPTION: Telomeres lost
      [[file:./Week 12/telomereslost_233853.png]]
    - Why is replication nearly perfect?
      - DNA polymerase has a "proofreader"
	- It checks the DNA it just made, and goes backwards if there is a mistake
      - Specific enzymes can come along and fix errors later
