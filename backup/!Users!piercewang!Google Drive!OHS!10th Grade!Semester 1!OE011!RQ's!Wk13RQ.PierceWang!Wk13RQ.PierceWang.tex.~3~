\section{Prompt(s)}
\label{sec:org48a8fa4}

  Building on the concept of the Internet as a physical space, David Weinberger, in "The Internet That Was (And Still Could Be)," says his "fear is that the Internet has been paved" (pg. 3). What does he mean? Do you buy it?

A term for the Internet that had wide currency especially in the 1990s was "information superhighway." What do you think? What attitudes/assumptions underlie it? Is it still applicable, or has our conception of the Internet (or highways) left it behind?

\section{Response}
\label{sec:orgef171cb}

  When a road is paved, that usually means that it has been traveled and discovered already. It is, in essence, the easy route. Perhaps the original view of the internet could be analagous to an undiscovered land, even continent. A paved road invites organization which invites control. With control, comes a lack of freedom. The internet's original values regards this freedom highly and the loss of it is not beneficial for the general populus, the common users of the internet. The internet is something that creates a place for the free sharing of ideas. While it is not always the best place for open ideas as social bubbles tend to form, it can very much be considered an information superhighway. However, it has changed much over the years. Initially, Google itself was a search engine that would give you any results you wanted. This was beneficial as it gave you access to the whole internet simply through one text box. However, nowadays, Google tailors their results strictly to your profile. Their aim is to keep you hooked on the platform and show you what they think you want to see. This creates a very confined social bubble and makes it such that the people become single-minded and unwilling to change their views. However, the internet \textbf{is} much larger than Google. Nowadays, there are search engines like DuckDuckGo who emphasize privacy in their mottos, "The search engine that doesn't track you." and make sure to show you the most relevant results to your search terms rather than showing what you want to see tailored to your Google account. The internet is still an information superhighway. However, the majority of internet users have become confined to one part of the highway: their favorite part for the single purpose of a large company gaining and keeping its users. With the term "information superhighway" comes the assumptions that the internet is open to all information. In addition, a highway is something that allows for fast transport of that information. This is something that has stuck with the Internet. However, it has also become much more than that, as it is no longer simply about transporting information, but because of the extensive web of nodes connected to the network, it has almost become a world of its own.
