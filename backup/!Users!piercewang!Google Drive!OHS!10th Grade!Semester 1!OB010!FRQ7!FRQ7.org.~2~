1. Quorum sensing is a system of signaling correlated to population density. It requires 1) a means of assessing the number of other individuals present, and 2) a standard response once a threshold is met. Some examples of how this is used include populations of bacteria coordinating gene expression, and social insects determining where to live. Those of you interested in physics and engineering can I am sure imagine applications with large numbers of small independent robots (drones, anyone?). For our purposes, consider the bioluminescent bacteria Aliivibrio fischeri (previously Vibrio fischeri), which live symbiotically in the photophores (light producing organs) of the Hawaiian bobtail squid, Euprymna scolopes. Under certain conditions, the bacteria produce light that allow the squid to better blend in with their surroundings. Quorum sensing actually comes in at numerous levels during the colonization and initiation of symbiosis, but here focus on the quorum sensing that controls the creation of bioluminescence. When the bacteria are free-living or in low number, there is no bioluminescence, but when the bacteria are in high number, transcription of luciferase is induced, leading to bioluminescence.

Here are some aspects of how this regulation works: The gene lux I codes for a protein LuxI which synthesizes a diffusible pheromone called 3OC6. When it is in high enough concentration, it combines with LuxR and binds to the “lux box”. This stimulates transcription of the luxICDABEG operon, which makes more 3OC6 and bioluminescence. See the cartoon on the next page. If you want to learn more about quorum sensing in the bioluminescent system, check out Bonnie Bassler’s TED Talk:

a) (6 points) Suppose a mutation prevents LuxR from forming an active complex. What would be the effect on this quorum sensing pathway?  Under what circumstances would the bacteria bioluminesce?

b) (6 points) Suppose a mutation (such as the ones that convert a proto-oncogene into an oncogene) causes the over-production of LuxI. What would be the effect on this quorum sensing pathway?  Under what circumstances would the bacteria bioluminesce?

c) (6 points) How might you take advantage of the quorum sensing system to design a novel antibiotic? There are many possibilities here…

d) (6 points) Describe how quorum sensing, in some ways, enables bacteria to act like much larger, multicellular organisms?

2. Cystic fibrosis is a hereditary disorder that results in difficulty breathing due to thick mucus in the lungs, and digestive troubles due to decreased enzyme production in the pancreas. It is most commonly caused by a mutation in the CFTR (Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator) gene. The following is the template strand for a region of the CFTR gene that contains the mutation. The wild type version of the DNA is the template strand in a healthy individual. The CF version is the template strand in a person with the disease.

Wild type DNA 3’ – CTTTTATAGTAGAAACCACAAAGGATA – 5’

CF DNA 3’ – CTTTTATAGTAGCCACAAAGGATA – 5’

    (15 points) Transcribe and translate both of the above pieces of DNA. Be sure to label the ends of each macromolecule (i.e. DNA with the 3’ and 5’ ends, and peptide with the C terminus and N terminus). Note that this region is merely a section from the middle of the coding sequence and is in the correct reading frame. There are no introns in the provided sequence.
    (6 points) What type of mutation is represented in this disease? What effect does it have on the primary structure of the protein? What effect might it have on the tertiary structure of the protein? Explain your responses.
    (5 points) Sometimes mutations affect gene regulation without altering the protein sequence. Describe one hypothesized situation that meets this criterion.
