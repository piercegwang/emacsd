Parables challenge us. As we’ve seen, the notion that parables are homely tales meant to convey 
moral instruction simply, in ways the common people—
even children—can understand, is inadequate. Choose either one or two of our parables, and explore the nature of the challenge therein. Suggestions: In what way(s) does the parable make the reader struggle? Why does the author do so? What does the author achieve by telling the story in parable rather than straightforwardly? Be as precise as you can—as above, “He makes the reader think” is by itself inadequate.
