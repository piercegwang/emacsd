1. Explain what this means, giving examples as necessary: “[Brown] also suggests that all nouns are to some extent metaphorical. Language grows by a kind of metaphorical extension. Metaphor is thus not an ornament added on top of language, but a principle built in at the most fundamental level of linguistic behavior” (63). Why does it matter that our minds make sense of the world via metaphor?

2. Why should we care about Victor? I don’t mean ethically—it’s of course sad that any person should grow up thus deprived—but rather what does he teach us about ourselves and how we understand the world?

   - Victor teaches us that we are not inherently smart. Our intelligence as humans very much comes from the accumulation of knowledge over the generations we have existed. Thus, by passing down knowledge from generation to generation, we have the special ability to learn more and develop faster. Victor shows us that we are very much a society based species. On our own, we would be much less useful and developed as we would have to develop the concepts we have worked so hard to set in place on our own for each person in each lifetime. From Victor, we can also infer that these concepts must be learned an early stage of life in order to be truly used in a useful way. Because Victor was already in puberty if not past it when Itard tried to teach him

3. So far as we can tell, Victor’s deficits are social in nature. That is, we don’t know that there was anything physically or neuro-cognitively wrong with him. So far as we know, his problem is that at some early stage in his cognitive and linguistic development he lost contact with people. Why does this matter? Does this mess with what we think of as “being human”?

4. There are several sentences here that pose a challenge. Choose one or more of these, paraphrase it/them, and gimme your thoughts thereunto: “Victor then seemed puzzled …” (para. 9), “The use of language to make …” (para. 12), “The various appearances …” (para. 14), “Any sort of recurrence …” (para. 15).
