   - When two curves intersect at right angles, then the slopes of the tangent lines are perpendicular
     - The derivatives of those functions at that point are also negative reciprocals of each other
   - Future applications we can appreciate now
     - Find a non-zero function $f(x)$ such that $2xf(x) = -x^2 f'(x)$
     - Possible Paths
       - Take the derivative of both sides:
	 - $2xf'(x) + \frac{d}{dx}[2x]f(x)=\frac{d}{dx}[-x^2]f'(x)-x^2*(d/dx)[f'(x)]$
       - $\lim_{x\to0} \frac{sin(x)}{x} = 1$

   - An implicitly defined function is one where x and y are given on both sides (not just y = blah blah x)
** W6D1 <2018-10-01 Mon>
   - Differentiability
   - For a function $f$ to be differentiable at a point $c$, $f$ has to be continuous at point $c$ and $\lim_{h\to0}\frac{f(c+h)-f(c)}{h}$
   - This Condition fails if
     - $f$ is discontinuous at $c$
     - there is a corner at $c$
       - A corner such as $x=0$ in $f(x) = |x|$
     - the limit grows without bound
   - $xsin(\frac{1}{x})$ will always be between $-|x|$ and $|x|$ because $sin()$ will always be between 1 and -1.
     - Therefore, $-|x| \leq xsin(\frac{1}{x}) \leq |x|$
   - The Chain Rule
     - If g is differentable at x and f is differentiable at g(x), then the composite function $F=f \circ g$ defined by $F(x) = f(g(x))$ is differentiable at $x$ and $F'$ is given by the product
       - $F'(x) = f'(g(x)) \cdot g'(x)$
     - In Leibniz notation, if $y=f(u)$ and $u=g(x)$ are both differentiable functions, then
       - $\frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{dy}{du}\frac{du}{dx}$

   $2x^2sqrt(3) \\$
   $g(f(x))' =4xsqrt(3) \\$

   Find F'(3) where F(x) = f(g(x)), and

   $f'(g(x)) \cdot g'(x) = f'(5) \cdot g'(3) = -1 \cdot 7 \\
   -1 \cdot 7 = -7$

   - Implicit Differentiation
     - Treat $y$ as if it were a function of $x$, with derivative $\frac{dy}{dx}$
     - Any expression involving $x$ and $y$ may be differentiated with respect to $x$, being sure to remember sum, quotient, product, chain rules, etc.
     - Differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to $x$
     - Solve for $\frac{dy}{dx}$
     - If we plug in a specific point P(x,y) on the graph, we will get the slope of the tangent line at P.

Find: $\frac{dx}{dt} \\$

$x^2 + h^2 = 13^2 \\
\frac{d}{dt}(x^2+h^2)=\frac{d}{dt}(13^2) \\

	- Linear Approximation
*** Linear Approximation
In general, the tangent line to a curve gives a very good approximation to the curve as long as you don't go "too far." When x is near a, we have:

$f(x) ~ f(a) + f'(a)(x-a)$

This is called linear approximation or tangent line approximation of f at a

to approximate f(x), we look for a point a "nearby" where both f(a) and f'(a) are easy to compute

**** Example 1.

$f(x)=\dfrac{1}{\sqrt[3]{1+x}}$

$f(0)+f'(0)(0.1-0)$

$1 - \frac{1}{3}(x-0)$

$1-\dfrac{1}{3}x$

$1-\frac{1}{3}0.1$

$̣\dfrac{29}{30}$

**** Example 2
$f(x) = cos\left(\dfrac{\pi}{3}\right)$

V = (πr^2h)/3
Volume of a cone^ 

Given:
dV/dt = 5

dV/dt = d/dt((πr^2h)/3)
dV/dt = π/3 * d/dt((r^2h))
dV/dt = π/3 * ((2r * dr/dt * h) + (r^2 * dh/dt))
5 = pi/3 * ((2*4 * dr/dt * 8) + (16 * dh/dt)) 
5 = pi/3 * ((64 * dr/dt) + (16 * dh/dt))
5 = pi/3 * ((32 * dh/dt) + (16 * dh/dt))
5 = pi/3 * (48 * dh/dt)
5 = 48pi/3 * dh/dt
5/16pi = dh/dt

The rate of the change of depth is 5/16pi ft/min

r/h = 10/20 = 1/2
r = h/2

radius  = 4

h = 2r => dh/dt = 2 dr/dt
then substitute

Problem 2.

f(x) = tan(x)
a = pi/4
y = f(a) + f'(a)(x-a)
y = f(pi/4) + f'(pi/4)(x-pi/4)
y = 1 + 2 (1pi/40)
y = 1 + pi/20

Problem 3.

y = (1 + x^3)^1/2
(x, y) = (2, 3)

find: dx/dt

dy/dt = dx/dt * 3x^2/2 * 1/sqrt(1 + x^3)
1 = dx/dt * 6 * 1/3
1 = 2 dx/dt
dx/dt = 1/2

d * dd/dt = dx/dt (x - 5) + dy/dt (y - 12)
d = 13 because of pythagorean triple (5, 12, 13)

13 * dd/dt = -(x - 5) - 5(y - 12)

     - Increasing :: $f$ is /increasing/ on the interval if $f(x_1) < f(x_2)$ whenever $x_1 < x_2$
     - Decreasing :: $f$ is /decreasing/ on the interval if $f(x_1) > f(x_2)$ whenever $x_1 < x_2$
     - Constant :: $f$ is /constant/ on the interval if $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$ for all points x_1 and x_2
   - Theorem: Let f be a function that is continuous on a closed interval [a,b] and differentiable on the open interval (a,b)
     1. If f'(x) > 0 for every value of x in (a,b), then f is increasing on [a,b]
     2. If f'(x) < 0  for every value of x in (a,b), then f is decreasing on [a,b]
     3. If f'(x) = 0 for every value of x = (a,b), then f is constant on [a,b]
   - To find where a function is increasing or decreasing:

** Ch. 3.1 Lecture 2
   - Definitions
     - If /f/ is differentiable on an open interval, then /f/ is said to be /concave up/ on the open interval if /f'/ is increasing on that interval, and /f/ is said to /concave down/ on the open interval if /f'/ is decreasing on that interval
     - A function is increasing if its derivative is positive
     - /f'/ is inc when /f''/ > 0
     - /f'/ is dec when /f''/ < 0
     - If /f/ is continuous on an open interval containing a value x_0, and if f changes concavity at the point (x_0, f(x_0)), then we say that f has an inflection at x_0, and we call the point (x_0, f(x_0)) on the graph of f an /inflection point/ of f
   - Theorem
     - Let /f/ be twice differentiable on an open interval
       1. If f''(x)>0 for every value of x in the open interval, then f is concave up on that interval
       2. If f''(x)<0 for every value of x in the open interval, then f is concave down in that interval

     - A function $f$ is said to have a /relative maximum at x_0/ if there is an open inerval containing x_0 on which $f(x_0)$ is the largest value, that is, $f(x_0) \geg f(x)$ for all x in the interval. Similarly, $f$ is said to have a /relative minimum at x_0/ if there is an open interval containing x_0 on which $f(x_0) is the smallest value, that is, $f(x_0) \leq f(x)$ for all x in the interval. If /f/ has either a relative maximum or a relative minimum at x_0, then /f/ is said to have a relative extremum at x_0.
   - Theorem
     - Suppose that /f/ is a function defined on an open interval containing the point x_0. If /f/ has a relative extremum at x=x_0, then x=x_0 is a critical point of /f/: that is, either f'(x_0) = 0 or f is not differentiable at x_0

   - Extreme Value Theorem
     - A continuous function f(x) on a closed interval [a,b] *ALWAYS* attains a global (absolute) maximum and a global (absolute) minimum.
     - Any global extrema msut be at one of three types of points:
       - An endpoint of the interval (either a or b)
       - at a point where f(x) is not differentiable
       - at a point where f'(x) = 0 (i.e. a stationary point)
       - Extreme value theorem is not saying you can't have a global extrema if these two conditions are met, it's just saying that it's guaranteed to have them if these conditions are met
       - Only talks about guaranteeing

   - General Strategy
     - Identify the quantity to be maximized or minimized and express it as a funciton of the relevant parameter
       - Often a diagram is helpful in this
       - Be sure you know the domain! it's easiest if it can eb a closed itnerval, but that's not always possible
     - Apply techniques of calculus to find the relevant extrema
     - Once you have found the absolute maximum or minium, be sure to interpret your result correclty and answer the question that was asked! Were you asked for the maximum or minimum value itself, or were you asked for he value the parameter should be to achieve that extreme value?
   - Steps
     1) Examine Problem
     2) Come up with an equation that represents the value to be maximized/minimized with relation to one variable
     3) Take first derivative of the function
     4) Find when the derivative equation = 0 which will be local extrema

   - Rectilinear motion
     - The method of an object moving in a straight line
     - Position is a funciton of time
     - Its PATH is along a straight line
     - It could move back and forth along the line
     - Examples:
       - A ball thrown up in the air on a straight line
   - Terminology
     - Position function s(t)
     - Displacement = *change* in position = s(t_{2}) - s(t_{1})
     - Average velocity = $\frac{s(t_2)-s(t_1)}{t_2-t_1}$
     - (Instantaneous) Velocity v(t) = s'(t) describes how fast and in what direction the particle is moving
     - Speed = |v(t)| describes only how fast the particle is moving
     - Accerlation a(t) = v'(t) = s''(t)
   - Physical interpretation of sign (+/-) of derivatives
     - Direction of motion
       - If v(t) > 0, the object is moving to the right on the position-axis
       - If v(t) < 0, the object is moving to the left on the position-axis
       - If v(t) = 0, the object is paused
     - *Speeding up* and *Slowing down*
       - The object *speeds up* when the velocity is positive and increasing (v(t) and a(t) are both positive) and also when the velocity is negative and and decreasing (v(t) and a(t) are both negative). In other words, *the velocity and acceleration have the same sign.* (The object is pushed in the same direction it is moving.)
       - The object *slows down* when v(t) and a(t) have opposite signs.
       - The object is moving at *constant velocity* if a(t) = 0
   - and for a(t)... then -4.9t^2 + cx + d maybe?
   - Position of an object in freefall = s(t) = -4.9t^2 + v_0t + s_0
     - a(t) = -9.8
     - v(t) = -9.8t+v_0
     - s(t) = -4.9t^2 + v_0t + s_0
   - to get a graph of the *speed*, take derivative of abs(v(t))

   - Rolle's Theorem
     - Let $f$ be a function that satisfies the following three hypothesis:
       - f is continuous on the closed interval [a,b]
       - f is differentiable on the open interval (a,b)
       - f(a) = f(b)
       - then there is a number c in (a,b) such that f'(x) = 0
     - at some point, the instantaneous velocity of the object = the total velocity of the object
     - Sketch of proof:
       - f(x) is continuous on [a,b], so the Extreme Value of Theorem implies the existence of extrema
       - Where do we expect the extrema to be located?
       - How does that apply when f(a) = f(b)?
	 - horizontal line
     - Remarks
       - Make sure:
	 - State f(x) is continuous on [a,b] and differentiable on (a,b)
	 - Show that f(a) = f(b)
	 - State that there exists at least one x = c in (a,b) such that f'(x) = 0
       - Notes:
	 - only guarnantees the existance of at least one point
	 - does not tell how to find it, or how many
     - Consequences:
       - Root finding
	 - Rolle's Theorem can be used to prove the existance of roots because it implies that the derivative of any polynomial must have roots in between the roots of the original polynomial
       - 
   - Mean Value Theorem (MVT)
     - Let f be a function that satisfies the following hypothesis
       - f is continuous ont eh closed interval [a,b]
       - f is differentiable on the open interval (a,b)
       - Then there is a number (a,b) such that
       - 1: f'(c) = $\frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b-a}$
       - 2: $f(b) - f(a) = f'(c)(b-a)$
	 - f'(c)(b-a) is the change over t
     - Consequences
       - look at lecture
   - Slight modification of due dates

Show that 6x^5 - 4x + 1 = 0 has at least one solution in the interval (0,1)
f(0) = 1

f(x) = x^3 - 3x + 2
continuous and differentiable because it's a polynomial
f'(x) = 3x^2 - 3
f'(c) = 1
c^2 = 4/3
c = +- 2/sqrt(3)

Applications of MVT

f(t_start) = 1500
f(t_later) = 390

Example 6.
t_0 = 0
t_final = 135

    - Integration by Substitution
      - If u = g(x) is a differentiable function whose range is an interval I and f is continuous on I, then
	- $\int f((x))g'(x)dx = \int f(u)du$
      - Choose a part of the integrand to call u such that the rest of the integrand is the derivativ eof u with respect to x (or only off by a constant factor)
      - Typically, let u be what is in the parenthesis, under a radical, or the trig function being raised to a power

*** Notes
    - Signed area
      - If the function f takes on both positive and negative values, we will treat the area under the x-axis as negative area
    - Integrable function
      - a function f is said to be integrable on a finite closed integral [a, b] if the limit
	- $\lim_{max \delta x_{k} \to 0} \sum_{k=1}^n f(x_{k}^{*} \delta x_k$
    - Properties
      - If f is integrable on a closed interval containing the three points a, b, and c, then
	- $\int_a^b f(x) dx = \int_a^c f(x) dx + \int_c^b f(x) dx$
      - If f is integrable on [a, b] and f(x) $\geq$ for all x in [a,b], then
	- $\int_a^b f(x)dx \geq 0$
      - If f and g are integrable on [a, b] and f(x) $\geq$ g(x) for all x in [a, b], then
	- $\int_a^b f(x) dx \geq \int_a^b g(x) dx$
