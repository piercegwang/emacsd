Question 1: In the past, mutations (changes in the DNA sequence) were
thought to occur randomly. However, several investigators have
hypothesized that environmental stress can induce mechanisms that
/increase/ the rate of mutation! One such mechanism in /E. coli/
involves switching from a nearly error-free DNA polymerase to an
error-prone DNA polymerase.

1. (10 points) Describe the “normal” way in which DNA polymerase can
   proofread DNA, and briefly describe at least two other DNA repair
   mechanisms

   1. Normally

2. (10 points) In contrast, speculate how the process that you described
   in part a might differ with an error-prone DNA polymerase. How might
   this result in a beneficial outcome for the bacteria? (Consider that
   mutations are commonly deleterious, but may be beneficial; consider
   also the typical mode of bacterial reproduction = binary fission)

Question 2: Eukaryotic chromosomes have special nucleotide sequences
called telomeres at their ends. These non-coding regions, which are
repeats of TTAGGG on one strand and AATCCC on the other, have been
compared to the plastic or metal-covered ends of shoelaces (word nerds:
those are aglets!). Their disappearance during replication cycles has
been related to aging.

1. (5 points) Briefly describe what happens during replication of the
   ends of linear chromosomes, and how this shortening can occur.
   Consider the leading and lagging strands, and the DNA sequence
   occupied by the primer.
2. (5 points) Why might the shortening of telomeres be related to aging?
   You may also argue that they are unrelated but be sure to support
   your argument with at least one piece of evidence.

Question 3: (5 points) Sunflowers with flowers 10 cm in diameter are
crossed with sunflowers with 20 cm flowers. The F1 plants have flowers
that are 15 cm in diameter. In the F2 generation, 4 flowers are 10 cm in
diameter, 4 are 20 cm in diameter, and there are 5 phenotypic classes
with diameters intermediate to the extremes.

1. Assuming that the alleles that contribute to flower diameter act
   additively, how many genes control flower size in this strain of
   sunflowers?
2. How much does each additive allele contribute to flower diameter?
3. If there are 256 flowers, how many would you expect in each size
   class?

Question 4: (5 points) Assume that humanlike creatures exist on Mars. As
in the human population on Earth, there are two sexes and even
sex-linked genes. The gene for eye color is an example of one such gene.
It has two alleles. The purple allele is dominant to the yellow allele.
A purple-eyed female alien mates with a purple-eyed male. All of the
male offspring are purple-eyed, while half the female offspring are
purple-eyed, and half are yellow-eyed. Which is the heterogametic sex?
Draw out the two options of the Punnett squares in support of your
explanation.

Question 5: (5 points) Males have only one X chromosome, and therefore
only one copy of all genes on the X chromosome (except for the few that
are homologous on the Y). Females have two X chromosomes, but one is
always inactivated. Therefore, females, like males, have only one
functional copy of all of the genes on the X chromosome. Why are females
not considered hemizygous, and why are they not afflicted with sex-lined
recessive diseases as often as males are?

Question 6: (5 points) A wild-type fruit fly (heterozygous for gray body
color and normal wings) is crossed with a black fly with vestigial wings
(both mutant recessive phenotypes). The offspring have the following
phenotypic distribution: wildtype: 778; black body vestigial: 785; black
body normal wing: 158; grey body vestigial wing: 162. What is the
recombination frequency between the genes for body color and wing size?
If there is 9% recombination between the genes for body color and red
vs. cinnabar eye color, how do you expect the genes for body color, eye
color, and wing size to be arranged on the chromosome? Is there just one
option?
