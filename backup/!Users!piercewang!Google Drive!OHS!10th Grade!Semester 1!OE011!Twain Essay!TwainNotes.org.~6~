* Prompt
Prompt:
5. Huck is a very talky character: it’s not just that he’s our first-person narrator, but also that Twain has made him especially voluble, reflecting on his experiences and giving us a running commentary on his feelings, and (often) other people’s feelings as well. So, it’s notable when he doesn’t offer commentary. Choose one instance in which Huck remains silent (or at most two), explain why he does so, and why that matters to our understanding of the novel.

* Outline
Thesis:
Huck's silence at this moment shows his indecision and influences our interpretation of the novel to be much more than that of a simple story. Rather, we are encouraged to perceive it as a story that shows the brutality of the world from a young boy in society's point of view.

- Weave more why it's important into the introduction paragraph
- firs tbody paragraph
  - Emphasize silence?
* WRITEIN
  - Does Huck's silence following Buck's death signal indecision? If so, what is he indecisive about?
  - Could his silence (especially with Jim) = a form of freedom
  - In what ways might the silence bind Huck to these experiences in a way that giving voice to them does not
    - Example: At the beginning of the gettysburg address: None of the words that Lincoln says can significantly encompass the lives lost on the battlefield
  - Whatever words that Huck *could* come up with may not do it justice
  - Significance of the silences, how they are voids, but how they can be loaded with meaning

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Huckleberry Finn, the protagonist in Mark Twain’s novel, /Huckleberry Finn/, is a young boy of around fourteen years of age. Throughout the novel, Huck Finn has many adventures and travels over very long distances. Through these adventures, he experiences things that were taboo for the time and would be even more taboo nowadays. When Huck meets Buck, they instantly get along well. In fact, he fits in very well with the Grangerford family as a whole. However, tragedy soon strikes as the family’s fued finally takes its toll on Buck. With a gun fight comes Buck’s parting from the plane of existance. Huck, meanwhile, has been watching from a tree above and is devastated to see Buck hurt. In another instance, we simply hear Jim talking about his family as if he were talking directly to us. After this story is told by Jim, we move on to the next chapter without a word from Huck. His silence at this moment shows his indecision and influences our interpretation of the novel to be much more than that of a simple story. Rather, we are encouraged to perceive it as a story that shows the brutality of the world from a young boy in society’s point of view.

  In the first instance, we see Huck witness the death of his friend, Buck. Buck is the closest thing to a brother Huck has. In addition, Buck’s family is the closest thing Huck has to a normal family. Though they are cautious at first, they take him in willingly and kindly. Since they meet, Huck and Buck share cloths and converse extremely comfortably. Thus, Buck’s death comes as a huge shock for Huck as Huck openly admits that recounting the whole story would "make him sick again." (134) In most other places in this novel, we are shown a fearless and free Huck Finn. However, in this moment he admits he is "afraid to come down" from the tree and is "down-hearted" because of his view of the situation. Dealing with death is something that is hard for everyone. Death and murder is something that Huck is accustomed to the idea of. However, much of the "casual" death that he experiences is simply imagination. For example, at the beginning of the novel in Tom Sawyer’s gang of sorts, they supposedly rob and murder people. However, they obviously do not really rob and murder anyone. They simply pretend and make believe. In all other instances of death we see in Huck Finn, it is either someone who has abused and unfairly treated him (Huck’s father) or someone who he does not have any relationship with (the burglars on the boat). Thus, the circumstance is not one to warrant great emotional grief. In this case, however, Buck is someone who has, in Huck’s words, been "mighty good to [Huck]." (134) This passage, and the simplicity of the language shows a side of the novel that contains the innocents and immaturity of Huck and that personality as it fits into the society of that time.

  Twain writes this novel so that the audience could see through Huck’s point of view the prejudices based in society and the moral problems which are posed by them. Throughout the novel, Jim becomes quite a close friend for Huck. While Huck still regards Jim as a nigger, Jim becomes much more to Huck. When Jim and Huck get separated by the fog, Jim becomes genuinely worried about Huck. However, once they reunite, Huck decides to play a trick on Jim: "'En all you wuz thinkin 'bout wuz how you could make a fool uv ole Jim wid a lie.' ... that was enough. It made me feel so mean I could almost kissed /his/ foot get him to take it back." (95) Huck at this moment feels remorse for playing the trick on Jim and eventually does apologize. Thus, when Jim feels homesick and tells Huck of his family at home, Huck can't help but start thinking of Jim as a human being rather than just a nigger or just a tool. During this story, Huck stays completely silent. Even after, Huck never comments on the story. As is known, Huck has never had a proper family. Thus, hearing of Jim’s family is not something that Huck would be accustomed to. Perhaps because of this, Huck lacks the experience and wisdom to articulate his own response to this and leaves it as is. Through this, we see another pointer to the idea that despite Huck’s abnormal comfort with death and the general morbid, he is still simply a kid lacking a family and is thus incapable of completely understanding Jim’s situation.

Through this, we see another pointer to the idea that despite Huck’s abnormal comfort with death and the general morbid, he is still simply a kid lacking a family and is thus incapable of completely understanding Jim’s situation.

  If we are to interpret lack of speech on Huck’s part as simply a lack of experience, then the story that Jim tells is left to the audience to interpret. Twain, through this passage, is almost directly communicating with the audience and communicating his pain and remorse in hitting his daughter. Jim communicates that he has a family just like the white folks. This is extremely hard to comprehend especially for Huck as it leads him ultimately to the moral dilemma of the freeing of Jim. As the audience, we see the moral dilemma that Huck is in from a spectator’s perspective and would be able to point out that Huck is doing the morally right thing. Of course this is not the case from Huck’s point of view and he has decidedly deemed himself wrong and immoral according to the morals and rules of right and wrong that society has taught him. Thus, Twain is aiming to make Huck’s moral dilemma apparent for the audience so that the readers would be more inclined to ponder the moral dilemma in their own life. This argument is further justified with Twain’s comment at the very beginning of the book "threatening" the reader not to "find a motive ... find a moral ... find a plot" or he/she will be shot. By writing this note, he encourages the reader to search for these things in the story and search for a meaning. Debatably, the most important of which being the moral.

By writing this note, he encourages the reader to search for these things in the story and search for a meaning. Debatably, the most important of which being the moral. Thus, Huck's silence at this point is ultimately a strategy that Twain uses to direct the reader to ponder Jim's story more thoughtfully.

  This silence also affects our understanding of Huck's decision to leave behind civilization and go out into the wilderness. The two points of silence discussed previously show developments in Huck's character. While Huck never realizes what true moral correctness means, he knows he cannot live in society just like everyone else. This final choice that Huck makes shows his realization that he no longer fits in society. To live a life that he wants to live, he must go away from the society that taught him all he knows. Our interpretation of this novel is shaped meticulously by Mark Twain. In this novel, Twain shows the white society from quite a brutal point of view. Through Huck's silence that comes with Buck's death, we glimpse the pain Buck feels as one of the only true friends he has ever had is lost. 

** Second Draft
  Huck's silence at these two moments shows his inability to accurately represent what family means to him. In the instance with Buck, we see the inability to describe what Huck's loss feels like because Buck was such a good friend. In the instance with Jim, we see that Huck has a hard time comprehending and articulating any response to Jim as he himself has not known the kind of love Jim feels for his daughter.
  Buck was the closest thing to a brother Huck has had. When Huck first meets Buck, we immediately see them converse very openly. Buck instantly accepts Huck as a friend and tells him of recent events just as old friends might. They share clothing and even a room. Sharing a room, even though both are boys, still seems an unusual action by the family and shows to what degree they have accepted Huck. This familial connection that Huck develops is very important because it helps evolves Huck's character from that of a boy with an abusive father to one that might start grasping the concept of family and what that means. In addition, Thus, Buck’s death comes as a huge shock for Huck as Huck openly admits that recounting the whole story would "make him sick again." (134) In most other places in this novel, we are shown a fearless and free Huck Finn. However, in this moment he admits he is "afraid to come down" from the tree and is "down-hearted" because of his view of the situation. Dealing with death is something that is hard for everyone. Death and murder is something that Huck is accustomed to the idea of. However, much of the "casual" death that he experiences is simply imagination. For example, at the beginning of the novel in Tom Sawyer’s gang of sorts, they supposedly rob and murder people. However, they obviously do not really rob and murder anyone. They simply pretend and make believe. In all other instances of death we see in Huck Finn, it is either someone who has abused and unfairly treated him (Huck’s father) or someone who he does not have any relationship with (the burglars on the boat). Thus, the circumstance is not one to warrant great emotional grief. In this case, however, Buck is someone who has, in Huck’s words, been "mighty good to [Huck]." (134) This passage, and the simplicity of the language shows a side of the novel that contains the innocents and immaturity of Huck and his inability to sufficiently articulate how he feels about Buck’s death.
  In addition to this idea of family in relation to Huck, we see another instance of silence in which he hears about Jim's family. This particular instance is extremely important as well because it 

* Outline
  Thesis: Huck's silence 

* Ideas
** Buck dies
   - Huck felt Buck was a brother to him
   - Silence surrounding his death because Huck doesn't want to talk about it
   - Familial status of Buck to Huck means it has a bigger impact on Huck

** Jim's story
   - Jim 

* Notes from Class
  - The Challenge for prompt 5 (same as 3 and sort of 2) articulate the logic that connects the part to the whole
  - Why does it matter that we understand his silence here?
    - Is it that it's something he lacks the capacity to articulate?
    - Toni Morrison talks about Jim's story and how he doesn't say anything
      - Shows how limited huck is, never experienced parental love
      - Doesn't understand black pain, black emotional pain, something on which he can't comment because he doesn't have any way to make sense of what he's seeing
      - Does it not speak because he is so overwhelmed that speaking would cause him great pain
      - Is he concealing something from us?
	- Asserting some right to privacy?
    - Why is he not talking more
    - Use that to understand something more about the novel as a whole
    - This is a fruitful passage, arguing that this specific understanding of his silence here gives us an idea that has explanatory value beyond just this episode, points outward on the novel,
      - *Remember the core job of literary argument, zero in on those things in the text or about the text that need explaining, the extended hand questions*
      - An idea that has explanatory value
    - One "so what" that is available to anyone is "How do we understand the rationale behind his last decision, to leave for the wilderness rather than staying and being 'sivilized'"
  - Use Gaughman has as tool, don't turn it into a Gaughmanian analysis
* Things to know
  - the word "Death" never appears in the part around buck
