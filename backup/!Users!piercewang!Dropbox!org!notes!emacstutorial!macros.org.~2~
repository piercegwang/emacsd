* Good things to know
  1. '=M=' refers to the "meta" key, aka the "alt" key on most keyboards today
  2. '=C=' refers to the "control" key
  3. '=M-x=' is by default bound to =(execute-extended-command)= and is going to be one of the keybinds you most often use
  4. '=C-g=' runs =(keyboard-quit)= It is /the/ most useful keybind in Emacs
  5. I just wanted to mention those.... there's a few other really useful ones but I'm sure you already know them
     - If you don't, I highly recommend the *[[https://www.emacswiki.org][Emacs Wiki]]*

* The General Steps to Creating a Macro
  1. Use either '=<F3>=' or '=C-x (=' to start the recording of a macro
  2. Input keybinds that will be repeated exactly when you run the macro
     + Use less specific keybinds like '=C-a=' (navigate to beginning of line) or '=M-f=' to move forward a word to navigate when making the macro unless you are *totally* sure that there will be a specific number of characters
     + During the macro creation, you can press '=<F3>=' to run the function (kmacro-start-macro-or-insert-counter) which, because you're defining a macro currently, will insert a counter which can be very useful when you need to create lists or want to input a number that keeps track of how many times the macro has been run.
  3. Use either '=<F4>=' or '=C-x )=' to end the recording of a macro
  4. To run the macro, either use '=<F4>=' or '=C-x e='
** If you want to save the macro
   1. After macro creation, run '=M-x name-last-kbd-macro=' then name your macro
   2. Go to your configuration file (preferably ~/.emacs.d/init.el, but yours may be something to the effect of .emacs in the home directory)
   3. Go to where in the file you want to input the keyboard macro and run '=M-x insert-kbd-macro=' then type the name of the macro you saved
   4. To bind the macro, add =(global-set-key (kbd "Some keybind here") 'yourmacro)= after the macro definition
* Example
  - Will put example here soon!
