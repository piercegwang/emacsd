  Building on the concept of the Internet as a physical space, David Weinberger, in "The Internet That Was (And Still Could Be)," says his "fear is that the Internet has been paved" (pg. 3). What does he mean? Do you buy it?

  A term for the Internet that had wide currency especially in the 1990s was "information superhighway." What do you think? What attitudes/assumptions underlie it? Is it still applicable, or has our conception of the Internet (or highways) left it behind?
