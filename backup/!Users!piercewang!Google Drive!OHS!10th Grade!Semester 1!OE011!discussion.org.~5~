  - Learning to integrate quotations is the single most valuable and quickly learnable _stylistic_ skill you can develop for writing academic papers.
  - The body paragraphs have to be tied together to your thesis and obviously pointing to it.
  - Remember the job that these three elements do
  - In this genre, the conclusion is the least important
  - Using Gaughman, interested in questions of identity
    - How does Guaghman help me understand what's happening between the two brothers
    - How does he help me understand why Blake is writing this at all?
    - See both brothers contesting over Blake's identity
    - wident out from that and ask why Brent is writing this down at all, and why is writing it down this way?
    - Trying to process the experience of failure with regard to his brother
    - Thesis is going to be about the relationship between the internal character struggle (Between Brent and Blake) and ask about the character as a whole, the struggle of identity of Brent Staples. Another way of saying why does Brent Staples write this anecdote.
      - Such as using images of his brother as a baby-faced toddler, why the struggle to commmunicate? Why the glass? Why did it end so abruptly?
      - Could get a fruitful thesis that describes the relationship between the internal character contest and the question "Why is Brent Staples writing this anecdote at all? What is he trying to achieve and work through?"

     - Interface between reader and text
   - We're not taking Huck Finn casually
   - Looking at scholarly perspectives on the novel, Twain, and race
   - Toni Morrison and reader-response, loving the book, and being horrified by the book
   - Huck Finn is a book that is made to horrify, it is designed to show the racism
   - The racial elements in Huck Finn are going to be... *difficult*
   - Later in the semester, we're going to be looking at the Bible
   - The word "nigger" appears over 200 times, and reading this can be a brutalizing experience, for anyone, but most especially for black students
   - the word "nigger" will come up in class reading and Dr. Nunnery is going to say it
   - We aren't required to say it, we can say "the N-word"
   - Seek out Sam Cooke: Shake.
     - 
** W6D2 Huck Finn Chapter 2
   - A drama of epistomology
   - Huck has to grapple with "How do I know?" "How do I choose?"

* Week 7
** W7D1
   - "De gustibus non disputandum est." - Do not argue over matters of taste
   - Why does Twain not come in after her story? Why does he not add a coda at the end? "Aunt Rachel"
   - Twain was trying to propogate her story as she told it such that it'd have a greater affect on the audience
   - 
* Week 8

   - Potential counterarguments are our friend, rake in the ground for them
   - The "jurisprudential approach" to argument

   - 
* Week 9
** W9D2
   - The Challenge for prompt 5 (same as 3 and sort of 2) articulate the logic that connects the part to the whole
   - Why does it matter that we understand his silence here?
     - Is it that it's something he lacks the capacity to articulate?
     - Toni Morrison talks about Jim's story and how he doesn't say anything
       - Shows how limited huck is, never experienced parental love
       - Doesn't understand black pain, black emotional pain, something on which he can't comment because he doesn't have any way to make sense of what he's seeing
       - Does it not speak because he is so overwhelmed that speaking would cause him great pain
       - Is he concealing something from us?
	 - Asserting some right to privacy?
     - Why is he not talking more
     - Use that to understand something more about the novel as a whole
     - This is a fruitful passage, arguing that this specific understanding of his silence here gives us an idea that has explanatory value beyond just this episode, points outward on the novel,
       - *Remember the core job of literary argument, zero in on those things in the text or about the text that need explaining, the extended hand questions*
       - An idea that has explanatory value
     - One "so what" that is available to anyone is "How do we understand the rationale behind his last decision, to leave for the wilderness rather than staying and being 'sivilized'"
   - Use Gaughman has as tool, don't turn it into a Gaughmanian analysis
   -
