* Lab Overview
** Introduction

In this lab, you get to be Gregor Mendel for a week. Instead of pea plants, you will be studying Wisconsin Fast Plants™ (http://www.fastplants.org). These plants were bred at the University of Wisconsin, Madison to have a remarkably fast life cycle. As you will see, these plants sprout within 24-48 hours. 

Just as Gregor Mendel did, you will score multiple phenotypes for two traits in combination in several generations. The characteristics that you will follow are stem color and leaf color. The stems will be purple or not purple, and leaves will be dark green or yellow-green. You will observe the sprouts from Fast Plant seeds and count the number of each combination of phenotypes: the number of sprouts with purple stem and green leaves, purple stem and yellow-green leaves, non-purple stem and green leaves, and non-purple stem and yellow-green leaves. You will observe both parental varieties (P1 and P2), the offspring of a cross between P1 and P2 plants (F1), and the offspring of a self-cross of F1 plants (F2).

Please contact Dr. Vetter (kmead@stanford.edu or ksmvetter@gmail.com) if you have any questions or concerns, and good luck!

** Before You Begin
   - *Remember* to read the entire protocol before you start. Do you understand it? Are you ready?
   - *Gather* all necessary materials. Make sure all materials are ready to use. You don’t want to be missing anything right when you need it!
   - *Set up* your light source. You can use natural light if you are somewhere really sunny, but otherwise the light will need to be on 24 hours a day for seven days, so choose the location wisely. The optimal distance between the petri dishes and the lamp is 8-10cm.

** Materials

   - [X] Packets of Wisconsin Fast Plant seeds (1 each of P1, P2, F1, and F2)
   - [X] Petri dishes (4)
   - [X] Sealable plastic bags (4)
   - [X] Filter paper
   - [ ] Water
   - [X] Scissors
   - [ ] Lamp (fluorescent is best)

** Protocol

    1. Label the bottom of the petri dishes for each of the seed types (P1, P2, F1, and F2).
    2. Cut a piece of filter paper to fit in the bottom of each petri dish. Add just enough water to fully moisten the filter paper without making puddles (I added 15 mL, swished, and poured out the excess).
    3. Evenly distribute the seeds from each packet into the appropriate petri dish.
    4. Replace the lid and place in a sealable plastic bag. Place each under the fluorescent lamp ~8-10 cm.
    5. Observe the seeds and sprouts every day for seven days, noting the combination of stem and leaf colors and ensuring that the filter paper remains moist. It is strongly recommended that you collect data every day as soon as it is possible rather than waiting until the end of the week. Mold and drying out and other things happen. *Make sure that you keep track of all four possible phenotypes in each petri dish separately.* In other words, for each of P1, P2, F1, and F2, you have to keep track of: (purple stem and dark green leaf)(purple stem and light green leaf)(non-purple stem and dark green leaf)(non-purple stem and light green leaf). Do this every day (and this will incidently also provide you with a measure of how repeatable your measurements are).

** Tips for performing this lab

   - The packets of seeds contain a variable number of seeds. Just use all of them that you have.
   - The filter paper doesn’t come in a handy size. I cut them to the proper size by tracing the bottom of the petri dish on one filter paper, stacking it with three others (so that there are four sheets of paper in a stack), and then cutting inside the line I traced.
   - A good method for properly wetting the filter paper is to use a plastic pipette. If you can dump excess water out of the petri dish, you’ve used too much. (Just dump out the excess, and you’re good to go.)
   - The protocol is fairly straightforward! About 95% of seeds usually sprout, so don’t be surprised if one or two don’t start growing. You should see growth within 48 hours.
   - The phenotypes may be difficult to score. I recommend looking over the plants and mentally deciding what is green and what is yellow-green in both the purple and non-purple plants, and then going back and scoring more carefully. Note that it will be more difficult to determine leaf color in the purple-stemmed plants. I found the color to be best on the inner surface of the leaves.

** Clean-up

   - All plastic ware can be thoroughly washed and reused. The filter paper and seeds can go in the trash. Be sure to leave your “lab bench” cleaner than when you found it. (Your parents will appreciate that.)

** Lab Report (slightly modified point values)

   - Cover sheet and title (5 points)
   - Introduction (20 points): Provide an introduction to Mendelian genetics particularly the laws of inheritance. Be sure to include a discussion of dominant/recessive alleles, heterozygous/homozygous alleles, phenotype/genotype, dihybrid crosses and the laws of segregation and independent assortment.
   - Materials and methods (5 points)
   - Results (25 points): Present your daily results and observations. A table is ideal for this purpose, but make sure to include summary comments in text form. For your hypothesis, consider your overall observations of P1 and P2, and form hypotheses for what you would expect for F1 and F2, given ideal conditions. Note: P1, P2, and F1 should be uniform, but the traits do not have 100% penetration, so you may well get outliers, especially if the light conditions are poor. Use the majority pattern in P1, P2, and F1 to make your predictions. You should get a mix of phenotypes in F2. You do not need to provide variables or controls. Note your comfort/accuracy in scoring the two traits. Make sure that you provide pictures of your seedlings, and that you record your data in a table and in the text.
   - Discussion (20 points):  To what extent do your data match your predictions? If not, what could you do to be more certain? What experimental errors (i.e. something you did) might influence your results?
   - References  (5 points): As usual
   - Post-lab Questions (20 points): Answer the questions posed below.

** Post-Lab Questions

   - How do your results exemplify Mendel’s Law of Segregation and the Law of Independent Assortment? If you have already addressed this in your discussion, you may refer to the specific page and paragraph as your answer.
   - Perform a Chi-squared analysis on your data, and determine if your data support your hypothesis for F2. Remember, the formula for Chi-squared and the degrees of freedom are on the formula sheet!

** Logs
   - [2018-11-04 Sun 10:02]
     - Top of petri dishes contained more water than expected, so I took them out, wiped them clear, then made sure to keep the filter papers moist with 5 drops of water each (except for P2)
     - Noticed many seeds have germinated however none are identifiable in terms of traits
   -
