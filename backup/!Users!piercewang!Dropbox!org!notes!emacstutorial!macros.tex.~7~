\section{Good things to know}
\label{sec:orge1db0f0}
\begin{enumerate}
\item '\texttt{M}' refers to the "meta" key, aka the "alt" key on most keyboards today
\item '\texttt{C}' refers to the "control" key
\item '\texttt{M-x}' is by default bound to \texttt{(execute-extended-command)} and is going to be one of the keybinds you most often use
\item '\texttt{C-g}' runs =(keyboard-quit) It is \emph{the} most useful keybind in Emacs
\item I just wanted to mention those\ldots{}. there's a few other really useful ones but I'm sure you already know them
\begin{itemize}
\item If you don't, I highly recommend the \textbf{\href{https://www.emacswiki.org}{Emacs Wiki}}
\end{itemize}

\section{The General Steps to Creating a Macro}
\label{sec:org6818f81}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Use either '\texttt{<F3>}' or '\texttt{C-x (}' to start the recording of a macro
\item Input keybinds that will be repeated exactly when you run the macro
\begin{itemize}
\item Use less specific keybinds like '\texttt{C-a}' (navigate to beginning of line) or '\texttt{M-f}' to move forward a word to navigate when making the macro unless you are \textbf{totally} sure that there will be a specific number of characters
\item During the macro creation, you can press '\texttt{<F3>}' to run the function (kmacro-start-macro-or-insert-counter) which, because you're defining a macro currently, will insert a counter which can be very useful when you need to create lists or want to input a number that keeps track of how many times the macro has been run.
\end{itemize}
\item Use either '\texttt{<F4>}' or '\texttt{C-x )}' to end the recording of a macro
\item To run the macro, either use '\texttt{<F4>}' or '\texttt{C-x e}'
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{If you want to save the macro}
\label{sec:org825afda}
\begin{enumerate}
\item After macro creation, run '\texttt{M-x name-last-kbd-macro}' then name your macro
\item Go to your configuration file (preferably \textasciitilde{}/.emacs.d/init.el, but yours may be something to the effect of .emacs in the home directory)
\item Go to where in the file you want to input the keyboard macro and run '\texttt{M-x insert-kbd-macro}' then type the name of the macro you saved
\item To bind the macro, add \texttt{(global-set-key (kbd "Some keybind here") 'yourmacro)} after the macro definition
\end{enumerate}
