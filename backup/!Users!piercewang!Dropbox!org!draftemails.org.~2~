Hi Pierce, 

I hope this finds you well. How is your week going? 

It is hard to believe that we are already in week 10 of Fall semester- Happy November :) Only a month and half until Winter Break-- keep up the hard work!

I am writing to check in on how things are going for you. How are you feeling about your classes/workload right now? How did midterms go? How are you doing personally? I know October can be a busy month academically, hopefully things are starting to slow down? 

Let me know how you're doing and if there is anything I can do to help. If you'd like to set up some time to talk about anything or just check in you can do so here: http://www.calendly.com/varveris

I hope you're doing well and look forward to hearing from you soon!

Best,

Ms.V

Dear Ms. Varvaris,

I'm doing quite well! The two essays that caused the most stress for me were due yesterday and the day before so the workload is much less right now. I can't wait till winter break! Though of course, that does also mean that finals will be coming soon. Midterms went well I think, and this year has been a bit different (in a good way) for me as I've been much more organized. After the schoolyear started, I discovered Emacs and have been really interested in it ever since.

Currently, I am doing pretty well in terms of attitude. I've been afraid of burning out in school which I've noticed has been a problem in the past. Not necessarily with assignments but with taking quality notes on readings and such near the end of the semester. However, I've not at all noticed any slowdown for me as because I've implemented such a good note taking system in Emacs, I've had no trouble keeping up with the readings for classes. The only bad thing about Emacs so far is that my family and friends think I talk about it too much (which, to be frank, is totally true. I could go on and on about it!) so, I've taken to joining some online communities filled with people who are just as interested in Emacs as I am.

In any case, it seems like everything I talk about boils down to emacs (the last paragraph as an example)! So, overall, I'm doing really well and I'm very lucky to have some great family and friends to support me as well. Thank you for checking in!

Best,
Pierce

P.S. I hope you don't mind, I got a bit carried away and I probably won't proofread this message too much... so it's much more of a rant than any fleshed writing that I've done in the past two days.
