Dear Maestro Lohss,

I really appreciate your giving me the opportunity to perform again with you and really enjoyed these past two performances. Please extend my appreciation to all the orchestra members especially Mr. Baluyev. I look forward to our future collaborations! Thanks again!

Warm regards,

Hi Pierce, 

I hope this finds you well. How is your week going? 

It is hard to believe that we are already in week 10 of Fall semester- Happy November :) Only a month and half until Winter Break-- keep up the hard work!

I am writing to check in on how things are going for you. How are you feeling about your classes/workload right now? How did midterms go? How are you doing personally? I know October can be a busy month academically, hopefully things are starting to slow down? 

Let me know how you're doing and if there is anything I can do to help. If you'd like to set up some time to talk about anything or just check in you can do so here: http://www.calendly.com/varveris

I hope you're doing well and look forward to hearing from you soon!

Best,

Ms.V

Dear Ms. Varvaris,

I'm doing quite well! The two essays that caused the most stress for me were due yesterday and the day before so the workload is much less right now. I can't wait till winter break! Though of course, that does also mean that finals will be coming soon. Midterms went well I think, and this year has been a bit different (in a good way) for me as I've been much more organized. After the schoolyear started, I discovered Emacs and have been really interested in it ever since.

Currently, I am doing pretty well in terms of attitude. I've been afraid of burning out in school which I've noticed has been a problem in the past. Not necessarily with assignments but with taking quality notes on readings and such near the end of the semester. However, I've not at all noticed any slowdown for me as because I've implemented such a good note taking system in Emacs, I've had no trouble keeping up with the readings for classes. The only bad thing about Emacs so far is that my family and friends think I talk about it too much (which, to be frank, is totally true. I could go on and on about it!) so, I've taken to joining some online communities filled with people who are just as interested in Emacs as I am.

In any case, it seems like everything I talk about boils down to emacs (the last paragraph as an example)! So, overall, I'm doing really well and I'm very lucky to have some great family and friends to support me as well. Thank you for checking in!

Best,
Pierce

P.S. I hope you don't mind, I got a bit carried away and I probably won't proofread this message too much... so it's much more of a rant than any fleshed writing that I've done in the past two days.

** Draft #1
Dear Mr. Hurd,

Hi Mr. Hurd! I hope you've been well. School and violin has kept me very preoccupied and despite the workload, I have a great process for keeping everything organized. I am writing this emaiil to you because I was wondering if there would be any openings for an intern at Google this coming summer. Along with violin, I have also been very interested in coding and have done quite a few independent projects (mainly in Python). Despite these past projects, I would not consider myself at all proficient enough at programming to work at Google. However, through violin, I have learned discpline and would be very willing to go through anything to learn more. I would be extatic if you could at all give me an oppurtunity to intern at Google.

Dear Mr. Hurd,

I hope you've been well! School and violin have kept me quite busy. However, I have done a good job now of keeping track of time and making the most out of every moment in the day (while getting the appropriate rest at times). Along with these main two pursuits, I have been extremely interested in coding and have very much taken to doing as many projects as I can here and there. I have not taken an official programming course from my high school, Stanford Online. However, I have been trying to get as involved as possible in the programming world. I am writing you to ask if there are any intern positions available at Google and if I could participate at all. Through violin, I have learned the meaning of discipline and hard work and I would really appreciate this chance to learn as much as possible. Please let me know if there's any chance that I could intern at Google this coming summer. I would be willing to do anything!

Thanks,
Pierce

Dear Mr. Hurd, 

I hope you have been well! I'm writing to ask if there are any internships available at Google this coming summer. I have always been very interested in coding and software and despite my dedication to violin, I have also found time to pursue various programming projects involving my Raspberry Pi. I have since become very comfortable with the unix command line and I have really fallen in love with computer science. Despite this, I still have a lot to learn and would love to have the opportunity to spend a summer immersed in the kind of environment that I have witnessed at Google. I would be willing to fill any position that is open and would be very willing to work hard in learning anything I need. Please let me know if you there would be any positions available!

Sincerely,
Pierce

I hope you have been well. I have been quite busy with violin and school as earlier this fall I had the opportunity to solo with the Solano Symphony Orchestra. I’m also currently in 10th grade now at Stanford Online High School.

In my spare time I’ve been actively creating and carrying out programming projects involving my Raspberry Pi and have become an avid Emacs user, extoling the versatility of the “text editor” to anyone who will listen. I have also since become very comfortable with the Unix command line and have realized after some experience two summers ago at a coding camp that I envy people who get to solve problems and express creativity through programming. In thinking about this coming summer I discovered that I would really like to pursue a program or internship in computer science. I’ll be 16 after March and hope that an opportunity might exist for a motivated high school student like me.

I'm contacting you to ask if there might be any opportunities available at YouTube or Google this summer. I still have a lot to learn and would love to have the opportunity to spend a summer immersed in the kind of environment that I have witnessed at Google. I would be very willing to work hard to learn anything I need. Please let me know if you know of any programs available to high school students or any colleagues who might be interested in having an enthusiastic intern for the summer. Thank you for your continued interest and support.

Regards,
Pierce Wang

Dear Dr. DeMello,

I am currently preparing a resume for summer internship opportunities in computer science and I was wondering if you would be willing to provide a reference for me. If so, could you give me your preferred email and phone contact information to place on my resume?

Thank you,
