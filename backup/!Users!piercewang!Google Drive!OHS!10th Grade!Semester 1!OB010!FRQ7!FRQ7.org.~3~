1. Quorum sensing is a system of signaling correlated to population density. It requires 1) a means of assessing the number of other individuals present, and 2) a standard response once a threshold is met. Some examples of how this is used include populations of bacteria coordinating gene expression, and social insects determining where to live. Those of you interested in physics and engineering can I am sure imagine applications with large numbers of small independent robots (drones, anyone?). For our purposes, consider the bioluminescent bacteria /Aliivibrio fischeri/ (previously /Vibrio fischeri/), which live symbiotically in the photophores (light producing organs) of the Hawaiian bobtail squid, Euprymna scolopes. Under certain conditions, the bacteria produce light that allow the squid to better blend in with their surroundings. Quorum sensing actually comes in at numerous levels during the colonization and initiation of symbiosis, but here focus on the quorum sensing that controls the creation of bioluminescence. When the bacteria are free-living or in low number, there is no bioluminescence, but when the bacteria are in high number, transcription of luciferase is induced, leading to bioluminescence.

Here are some aspects of how this regulation works: The gene lux I codes for a protein LuxI which synthesizes a diffusible pheromone called 3OC6. When it is in high enough concentration, it combines with LuxR and binds to the “lux box”. This stimulates transcription of the luxICDABEG operon, which makes more 3OC6 and bioluminescence. See the cartoon on the next page. If you want to learn more about quorum sensing in the bioluminescent system, check out Bonnie Bassler’s TED Talk:
[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVfmUfr8VPA][Bonnie Bassler: The secret, social lives of bacteria]]

    1) (6 points) Suppose a mutation prevents LuxR from forming an active complex. What would be the effect on this quorum sensing pathway?  Under what circumstances would the bacteria bioluminesce?

       - This would cause the bacteria to be unable to bioluminesce because the bacteria need to be able to transcribe the luxICDABEG operon and to do that, the LuxR needs to bind the "lux box" to create an active complex.

    2) (6 points) Suppose a mutation (such as the ones that convert a proto-oncogene into an oncogene) causes the over-production of LuxI. What would be the effect on this quorum sensing pathway?  Under what circumstances would the bacteria bioluminesce?

       - If this were to occur, then the over-production of LuxI might cause there to be more 3OC6 than normal which would present a misrepresentation of the bacteria around and might cause bioluminscence to occur prematurely.

    3) (6 points) How might you take advantage of the quorum sensing system to design a novel antibiotic? There are many possibilities here…

       - One possibility would be to suppress the ability for the bacteria to receive signals. This might be accomplished by forming just different enough pheromones which would attach to the enzymes but not allow it to continue searching for other pheromones. In addition, one could attack a culture of bacteria such that it is no longer able to sense its environment through quorom sensing. Then, this culture could be released into the environment to disable other bacteria.

    4) (6 points) Describe how quorum sensing, in some ways, enables bacteria to act like much larger, multicellular organisms?

       - As an analogy, ants relatively very small compared to humans. However, they have the ability to do many amazing things just by working together. Forming raft-like contraptions with their bodies on water (fire ants) and making amazingly intricate tunnels as homes in the ground. In the case of bacteria, they are able to attack multicellular organisms like us in a much more efficient way. As mentioned in the TED talk, the bacteria first get into thehuman, but they do not attack. Instead, they wait and multiply until they have enough bacteria to launch an effective "attack" on the multicellular organism, or human. In another way, it could possibly allow them to know when to stop multiplying. One of the reasons for this would be overpopulation in a climate that does not provide enough resources for everyone. Thus, if there is not enough resources, then overpopulation would be detrimental to the whole of the population.

2. Cystic fibrosis is a hereditary disorder that results in difficulty breathing due to thick mucus in the lungs, and digestive troubles due to decreased enzyme production in the pancreas. It is most commonly caused by a mutation in the CFTR (Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator) gene. The following is the template strand for a region of the CFTR gene that contains the mutation. The wild type version of the DNA is the template strand in a healthy individual. The CF version is the template strand in a person with the disease.

Wild type DNA 3’ – CTTTTATAGTAGAAACCACAAAGGATA – 5’

CF DNA 3’ – CTTTTATAGTAGCCACAAAGGATA – 5’



    - (15 points) Transcribe and translate both of the above pieces of DNA. Be sure to label the ends of each macromolecule (i.e. DNA with the 3’ and 5’ ends, and peptide with the C terminus and N terminus). Note that this region is merely a section from the middle of the coding sequence and is in the correct reading frame. There are no introns in the provided sequence.

For this exercise, I decided to write a very very simple script simply to trancribe and translate the DNA such that I might not make any errors.


#+BEGIN_SRC python -n -i
# Short python script to replace a given DNA sequence with complementary
# amino acids and change T to U
def transcribe_dna(sDNA):
    fRNA = []
    for i in sDNA:
        if i == "C":
            fRNA.append("G")
        elif i == "G":
            fRNA.append("C")
        elif i == "A":
            fRNA.append("T")
        elif i == "T":
            fRNA.append("A")
    for i in range(len(fRNA)):
        if fRNA[i] == "T":
            fRNA[i] = "U"
    return ''.join(fRNA)

RNA = transcribe_dna('CTTTTATAGTAGAAACCACAAAGGATA')
return(RNA)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: GAAAAUAUCAUCUUUGGUGUUUCCUAU

Input the above results into the following program...


#+BEGIN_SRC python -n -i
# Another short python script to to split the input to make it easier to read
def split_dna(sRNA):
    final = []
    for n in range(0, len(sRNA), 3):
        final.append(sRNA[n:n+3])
    return(final)
return(split_dna('GAAAAUAUCAUCUUUGGUGUUUCCUAU'))

    - (6 points) What type of mutation is represented in this disease? What effect does it have on the primary structure of the protein? What effect might it have on the tertiary structure of the protein? Explain your responses.

      - This type of mutation is an deletion. In this case, the CF DNA is missing the UUU codons which would encode for Phenylalanine
      
    - (5 points) Sometimes mutations affect gene regulation without altering the protein sequence. Describe one hypothesized situation that meets this criterion.

      - One situation where this might occur is in the expression of certain genes. A mutation could occur that, rather than completely removing a protein from the coding sequence, would just make it produce less. This could be accomplished through the processes that make up gene regulation such as the operons in bacteria. A situation that would affect gene regulation without altering the protein sequence would involve the translator that makes the mRNA into proteins and the activator for that protein. That would not necessarily need a change in teh protein sequence, because it would have to do with the activator for the RNA polymerase.
