       - Geography
       - Political sphere
       - Attitudes
       - Philosophical growth
   - What is science?
     - Attempts at a definition:
       - Pattern of behavior by which humans have manipulated their
	 environment (including craft traditions and technology)
       - A body of theoretical knowledge, divisible into disciplines
       - Science is that which generates and pursues universal, law-like
	 statements objectively expressed (often in mathematical terms)
       - A certain set of procedures, often experimental, to explore
	 nature and disconfirm/confirm theories regarding it, using
	 rigor, objectivity, and precision
       - An epistemological stance that holds theories of nature to be
	 tentative and justified through evidence (as superior to
	 authority alone)
       - Concerns a particular set of beliefs about nature roughly
	 designated by academic disciplines.
     - First Starts
       - Awareness to limitations in tracing history of science (e.g.
	 oral traditions only)
       - Myths, anthropomorphism, art, trial-and-error, concretely
	 (rather than in disinterested or general causes)
       - Trial and error
       - Concrete entities, not necessarily generalizable
       - Agriculture brought hierarchies, cities, and a focus on
	 meteorology and astronomy. Healing arts were /always/ important
     - One thing to know how to do things, and another to know why things
       happen
       - You don't need to know the biochemistry of herbs to know
	 exactly which ones are poisonous or not
     - Logograms c. 3000 B.C.E.
     - Alphabetic writing c. 800 B.C.E.
       - Petrified what was once fluid, open to debate across space and
	 time, a visual immediacy to incompatibility, details, supported
	 philosophy
       - Not just thinking the thought but thinking of thinking the
	 thought
     - Circa 1600 B.C.E. Ebers and Edwin Smith papyri for cases of
       recipes and surgery
   - Order to things...
     - Some of the first "scientific' disciplines to form were medicine,
       astronomy, geometry, and math, though the 'scientific' aspect was
       broadly construed (detailed collection and organization of data,
       specialization, case studies etc.)
   - Greece is in the Mediterranean, close to lots of empires, just close
     enough to reap the benefits but not be controlled
   - A life conducive to inquiry?
     - Any small city-states of diverse political oganization in close
       proximity (including 'democratic' groups)
     - Geography diverse: mountainous natural boundaries, island and key
       waterways
     - Trade nexus
     - Debate is common
     - Pleasant climate
     - Near but not part of the massive militaristic empires (e.g.
       Persia, Egypt), that allowed important axes of information and
       goods, with the freedom to develop.

** W4L2 Scientific Demonstration
   - Terms
     - Natural science' was a special part of the larger philosophical
       questing for the nature of truth and reality. 'Science' didn't
       exist as we now understand it.
     - Natural science was comprised of 3 further studies
       - The cause of change in material things
       - Mathematics (the science of abstract quantity), and its close
	 kin
       - Metaphysics, which was concerned with /being/ as such and
	 structural characteristics of reality
	 - Episteme (knowledge)
	 - Theoria (contemplation/speculation)
	 - Philosophia (love of wisdom)
	 - Physis (nature, reality)
   - Unchanging Forms v. Empirical change
     - Thales: Inquiry into causes with general explanation. Theories can
       be compared, open to debate, laws and underlying truths are in
       nature and can be discovered!
     - Hidden Identity/Form/Substance vs. phenomena/change/reconstitution
     - 'Geometric demonstration', or proof as foundation template for
       knowledge
   - Plato's /Timaeus/:
     - Lauded geometry and mathematics,
     - Argued for a world based on design, principles and orderly
       patterns, visible to those who study,
     - A few elemental (geometric) substances cohered to form the
       diversity of experience
     - Reality--the enduring essence of the cosmos--is only indirectly
       glimpsed, and is akin to number and pure form
   - Aristotle, on the other hand, was interested in efficient causes, the
     physical changes. Empirical study was required in addition to
     mathematical abstraction of Plato to gain a proper understanding and
     give a proper account of reality. That is, using geometrical
     demonstration on the physical world.
     - Simply wanted to apply the mathematical abstraction far more
       directly and specifically to the physical world
   - Geometrical Demonstration I
     - The Greeks took 'metaphysics' and 'science' to distinguish either
       realms (in Plato's case) or aspects of the same subject matter (in
       Aristotle's case) and were generally concerned with classifying
       and structuring the relations between these forms of knowledge
       - Not so attentive to method
     - Was an awareness of theories that modeled reality as distinct from
       those that merely saved appearances--astronomers in particular
       were sensitive to the variety
     - Science was more about stories and logical constructions that
       correlated with observations (instrumentalism)
   - Geometrical Demonstration II
   - No set procedure, in this approach, dealing with many variables and
     complex phenomena
   - Aristotle (384-322 B.C.E.) notably broke with tradition in his
     empirical studies (largely biological)
   - Took scientific investigation and explanation to be a twofold process
     from induction to deduction and then back again
     - Senses --> Inductive analysis --> universal forms --> deduce the
       more general and foundational causes (as well as other specifics)
     - Then know the /reason for/ the fact, rather than simply the fact

** W5D2 <2018-09-26 Wed>
   - =Lucretius and the Atom Presentation by Finnian=
   - Who was Lucretius?
     - Born/Died
       - October 15, 99BC / 55 BC.
     - Largest Contribution
       - On the Nature of Things. - Book
     - Born in Pompey. Lived in Rome? (Possibly)
     - Lucretius's Core Beliefs
       - Atomism
	 - The world is made up of atoms and their interactions
	 - Atoms have weight, thus gravity influences them
	 - There is no net change for the universe
	 - Human experiences are due to atoms interacting, or seesing to interact (death).
	 - The Soul is even made of atoms.
	 - Beliefs on the origin of the universe (more later)
   - De Rerum Natura
     - Written in dactylic hexameter
     - Similar ideas as epicurus
     - "Vivifying poetic power"(75)
     - "Clear and lucid reasoning
   - Book 1: The Atom
     - Characteristic of the atom are...
     - Totally solid, indivisible and indestructible
     - Everlasting
     - Atoms cannot change, "fixed seed" idea.
     - Completely invisible, as they are so small
   - Book 2: The Void
     - Characteristics of the void are...
       - The empty space which atoms move through
       - Responsible for porosity.
       - Key component in weight.
	 - Essential for allowing atoms to "collide."
   - Atomism in Action!
     - Smooth atoms = smooth object, rough atoms = rough object
     - Weight is determined by the size and number of the individual atoms
     - Atoms fall *skewed* through the void
     - Collisions and interactions are responsible for all things as they fall.
     - "Natural laws and patterns regulate the union of various kinds of atoms"(83)
     - This theory is relevant to larger ideas
       - The creation of the universe did not have divine intervention
       - God still may exist though!
       - Nothing else in the world is alone...so why are we?
   - Lucretius was not that far off!
     - Similarities between modern atomic theory, and Lucretius' atomism...
       - The properties of atoms are responsible for properties of the object they make up.
       - The idea of the void.
       - The interactions between atoms produces many interesting effects.
   - =End of presentation=
   - Important things
     - His motivation for writing it
     - Method of presentation
       - Arguments by analogy (and other particular types of arguments used)
       - Poetry
   - Lucretius & Atomism
     :PASSAGE_FROM_BOOK:
     This terror, then, this darkness of the mind,
     Not sunrise with its flaring spokes of light,
     Nor glittering arrows of orning can disperse,
     But only Nature's aspect and her law,
     Which, teaching us, hath this exordium:
     Nothing from nothing ever yet was born.
     Fear holds ominion over mortality
     Only because, seeing in land and sky
     So much the cause whereof no wise they know,
     Men think Divinities are working there.

     Lucretius, On the Nature of Things, Book I
     :END:
   - Epicurus
     - Don't worry about things
   - For the time, it's astonishing how extensively Lucretius thought about it
   - Parmenides: "Nothing can come from nothing"
   - Democritus: indivisible, invisible particles of matter and void compos souls and bodies constantly in motion. Aggregation and dispersion bring about life and death as they randomly and necessarily (deterministically) move about and entangle.
   - Epicurus: Fear of death and divine intervention can be overcome with atomism (gods don't care about humans anyway), while preserving free will
   - Not to Epicurianism
     - See W5D2 Slides in Google Drive
   - We get very powerful argument types

* Week 6
** Lloyd Ch.4 "Problem of Change"
   - Heraclitus and Parmenides
   - Heraclietus :: claimed that everything is subject to change
     - Thought senses should be used with caution
   - Parmenides :: denied change can occur at all
     - Based his philosohpy on more radical view of the foundations of knowledge
     - reason *alone* is to be trusted and that the evidence of the senses is utterly unreliable and misleading
     - "It is and it cannot be"
       1) being or existance itself
       2) 'what is' in the sense of all that is, i.e. the totality of existing things
       3) 'what is' in the sense of anything that is, i.e. any particular object that exists
       4) 'what can be spoken or thought about'
     - Nothing can come to be from not-being
   - Empedocles :: reinstates the senses
     - Concedes that they are *feeble* instruemnts, but so too is the mind
     - use every means at our disposal (all senses) to grasp each thing
     - restores notion of change by denying the uniqueness of what exists
     - Love and Strife
     - 'element' :: an ambiguous term
       1) of 'oroginal' substances - existed as long as anything has existed
       2) 'simple' substances - elements that can't be reduced
     - expresses more clearly than any earlier writer the idea of substances that are both original and simple
     - refers to earth, water, air, and fire as /rhizomata/ or "roots" in a well-defined sense
     - the roots just *are*
     - draws a clear distinction of compounds and what they are composed of
     - roots are irreducible constituents into which other things can be analysed
     - differs from *modern science* because the roots are not chemically pure substances
     - earth, water, fire, air represented the different states of matter: solid, liquid, gas, plasma(?)
     - fragment 96 suggests bone was composed of fire, water, and earth in a ratio 4:2:2
     - Law of fixed proportions :: states that chemical compounds contain their constituent elements in fixed and invariable proportions by weight
   - Anaxagoras :: chose prose as his medium
     - the evidence of the senses provides the basis for inferences concerning what cannot be directly observed
     - "nothing can come to be from not-being" again (see mark a)
     - "existing things" :: In this context, with Anaxagoras, means every kind of natural substance, and also the opposites: the hot, cold, wet, dry
     - "In everything there is a portion of everything."
     - no natural substance is more elemntal, in the sense of simple, than any
   - Atomic theory
     + First suggested by Leucippus of Miletus
       - Little evidence that he applied the doctrine in detail to explain natural phenomena
     + developed by Democritus of Abdera
     + considered presocratic speculation
     + atom in Greek means indivisible
     + ancient atomism, fifth-century form = atoms and the void alone are real
     + Atoms are infinite in number and dispsered through an infinite void
     + Continuous motion, constant collisions between them
     + either atoms *rebound* or barbed or their shapes otherwise correspond to one another
       - cohere and thus form compound bodies
       - colour, taste, temperature, so on
       - atoms remain unaltered in substance
     + a response to Parmenides still
     + individual atoms are ungenerated, indestructible, unalterable, homogeneous, solid, and indivisible
     + 'bastard' knowledge :: knowledge provided by the senses
     + 'legitimate' knowledge :: knowledge of the mind
   - Much thought stemmed from Parmenides' denial of change
   - strung bow or lyer, while they seem at rest are in fact in a state of tension
   - Summation: Presocratic philosophers were concerned with the problem of change
     - still advnaced explanations of many different phenomena in meeorology, geology, physiology, embryology and other fields
     - The key problem in natural philosophy :: the nature of coming-to-be and change
       - the origin of the problem was a philosophical one
   - Philosophers: Empedocles, Anaxagoras, Leucippus, and Democritus
** A Brief History of Time Measurement
   - Moon phases, 30,000 years ago
   - reoccuring natural events led to natural divisions of the year
   - sundial :: can measure the length of a day
     - length of the day varies at different times of the year
   - Earth's axis tilted at 26 degrees
   - 2,000 BCE - Chinese calendars, 12 month year with the occasional occurance of a 13th month
   - 700 BCE - Babylonians begin to develop mathematical theory of astronomy
   - 500 BCE - equally divided 12-constellation zodiac appears
   - 616-907 CE - most comprehensive calendar, well ahead of any such development in Europe
   - 4,000 BCE - Oil Lamps
   - 1,500 BCE - Water Clocks
   - 14th century - Hour Glasses or Sandglasses
   - 1,500 BCE - Egyption sundial
   - 1275 - Earliest mechanical clock
   - 1656 - More accurate mechnical clocks, regulated by a mechanism with a "natural" period of oscillation
   - We now rely on atomic clocks and have adopted the GMT (Greenwhich Mean Time) as the international standard
** W6D1 <2018-10-01 Mon>
   - =Change and Time-Telling=
   - Things to say: Data (Star Trek) and time perception
   - Change requires time because change is delta_final - delta_initial
   - We take input from our senses and store it. Time is change and by remembering our sensory inputs, we can try to see differences from the past to now
   - Temporal Divisions and Importance
     - Why is time telling important?
     - What are some of the natural ways humans have divide time?
       - Seasonal flowering and decay
       - Wather patterns (e.g. monsoon season)
       - Migrating animals
       - Lunar, solar, sidereal change
	 - Shadows...
       - Heartbeats and biological changes
     - What is required for time telling?
       - Regularity?
	 - How can we be sure of it? What if all of our clocks were off?
       - Concious awareness of time?
   - Pre-socratics on Change *slide*
   - Water Clocks
     - Problems: pressure that the water comes out
     - evaporation
     - Oil lamps!
     - religion was very important in Medieval Europe
       - 
** W6L1 Aristotle Time as Motion
   - Overview: close reading of Aristotle
     - What *is* time?
     - Aristotle's overview of the debate?
     - Aristotle's positive account
   - Traditional Views
     - Some assert that it is
       1) The movement of the whole
       2) the sphere itself
     - Passages
       1) "Yet part, too, of the revolution is a time, but it certainly is not a revolution: for what is taken is part of a revolution, not a revolution. Besides, if there were more heavens than one, the movement of any of them equally would be time, so that there would be many times at the same time
       2) "Those who said that time is the sphere of the whole thought so, no doubt, on the ground that all things are in time and all things are in the sphere of the whole. The view is too naive for it to be worth while to consider the impossiblities implied by it
       3) But as time is most usually supposed to be (3) motion and a kind of change, we must consider this view. Now (a) the change or movement of each thing is only in the thing which changes or where the thing itself which moves or changes may chance to be. But time is present equally everywhere and with all things. Again, (b) change is always faster or slower, whereas time is not: for 'fast' and 'slow' are defined by time-'fast' is what moves much in a short time, 'slow' what moves little in a long time; but time is not defined by time, by being either a certain amount or a certain kind of it.
       4) Clearly then it is not movement
     - Time does not exist without change
     - we apprehend time when we mark motion by 'before' and 'after'
     - time is number [countable] of motion in respect of 'before' and 'after'
     - /Time is a measure of motion and of being moved/
   - Time: First Pass
     - Time is not held to be made up of 'nows'
     - connectivity
     - nowness is always the case, now is constantly referring to different things
     - when does now come into existence? does it go out of existence?
     - =Is the problem asking when with a question with now?=
     - Differentiated from a point, now has something
   - Temporal Sequence
     - A Mayan group speaking th eTzeltal language has developed a throroughly grounded sense of direction that dictates temporal progression
     - Some track time linearly and egocentrically -along the direction that they write
     - Some track time through stories or animal movements
     - /What/ does time mean?
** Paradoxes Presentation
   - Look up VSauce video on paradoxes (might be helpful?)
   - Time as a paradox, now?
   - 
** Le Poidevin - Infinity and Paradox
   - Zeno: How the Tortoise Beat Achilles
   - Zeno of Elea
   - Other paradoxes:
     - /Dichotomy/ ("Stadium")
     - the /Arrow/
     - /Moving Rows/ (Also sometimes called the Stadium)
   - "The reason that Achilles can complete an infinte number of tasks in a finite time is that each susccesive task takes a smaller and smaller amount of time."
   - If Aristotle is right: the process of dividing has no natural limit, and the infinite number of parts is discovered by the process of division
   - Thomson's lamp
     - Right answer: "We simply cannot predict"
   - Infinite things must exist in the now, the lamp is not infinite in space, but infinite in time

   - Zeno of Elea :: Creator of the Tortoise vs. Achilles Paradox
   - Achilles paradox
     - 100 yard headstart
     - No matter how fast Achilles runs, because time is infinitely divisible, the tortoise will always have moved that much more than him.

** TODO Aristotle "On the Heavens" Book 2, Chapter 14
   - confusion...
** TODO Lloyd Ch.8 ‘Aristotle’ excerpt (99-104 ONLY).
** W7D1 [2018-10-08 Mon]
   - How Aristotle Formatted and Argued his work
     - Organon - a tool defining deductive logic
     - Knowledge or episteme - "when we know the cause on which the fact depends as the cause of the fact, that the fact could not be otherwise."
     - Knowledge is proven by evidence or apodeixis
     - These demonstrations are formatted into syllogisms. (Premise 1, Preemise 2, Conclusion)
     - Knowledge is universal truth when proved true in any situation and it is in the broadest topic
     - Scientific knowledge is hte knowledge of causes
     - Takes the difficulties in arguments or commonly accepted views, uses indirect proofs to find the solution
*** Aristotle on Arguments
    - Aristotle on Arguments
      - Dialectical (logoi)
      - Destructive arguments - counters opponents views by finding a dilemma.
      - /reductio ad absurdum/- I reduce [your arugment] to absurdity
      - Evaluates all possible outcomes to find most satisfactory solution using elimination
    - Empirical (erga)
      - Appeals to the facts, data, and phenomena
      - Phainomena- phoenominons
      - Continue, screenshot
*** Aristotle's Argument
    - Motion
      - Matter is created by earth, air, fire, water.
      - Motion is never spontaneous
      - There is no motion without a mover
      - Natural motion - motion toward the natural place of the moving body
      - Forced or violin motion - motion in any other direction
      - Force and resistance
      - Heavy move downard - rocks
      - Ligh tmove upward - steam
    - Planetary Motion
      - Heavens are incorruptible substances, incapable of change
      - Fixed stars move with perfect uniformity, like they were fixed on a sphere
      - 7 stars (planets) displayed more intricate way of movement
    - The Earth is Stationary
      - Earth either moves like a star or on an axis
      - If earth moves it would be a constrained motion - beacuse itw ould have to move in a straight line to the center
      - Constrained and unnatural cannot be eternal. The universe is eternal
      - So either moves about its center or stationary at it - must move with two motions like other spheres
      - If ^ we would see passings and turnings of fixed stars, we haven't observed that
      - Stars rise and set at the same part of the Earth
      - Earth is stationary everything else moves aroun dit
    - The Earth is the center of the universe
      - All movement is towards the center
      - If both centers are the same earth wouldn't move
      - Goal to move towards must be center of the whole - fire and other things move in the extremity of the area which contains the center
      - Earth doesn't move at its own center because it is also the center of the universe
    - The earth is round! The earth is spherical!
    - The Earth is a Sphere
      - Every position of earth has weight until it reaches the center
      - When the 'mixture' was potential the pars were distributed uniformly from every side towards the center
      - Or parts which came together were distributed evenly
      - Or some other similar manner, the concept still remains
      - All mass is equidistant from the center, it will be spherical
      - This does not depend on size but rather can be universally applied to anything that has a centripetal force
*** Questions
    - Which way of arguing is more effective dialectical or empirical? How did this way of arguing shape argument and logic as we know it today?
    - Is Aristotle's definition of knowledge strong enough to be the basis of all of his facts for his arguments?
    - Do you think Aristotle's conclusion about earth is justified using the information he had?
 
** W7D2 [2018-10-10 Wed]
*** Maxwell O'Malley Presentation
    - Knowledge, matter and form, change, and motion
**** Today's Key Ideas
     - Aristotle's universe is an orderly organized world, a world of purpose, in which things devloped towards ends determined by their natures
     - He observes the ideas of earlier thinkers and questions theories and observations that other theorists put up. He also appeals to facts and uses a lot of deductive reasoning in his arguments
**** Personal fact
     - Sent to Athens to study with Plato at age 17
     - Questioned many of the ideas taht Plato posed
**** Aristotle with Matter and Form
     - Form and matter
       - Form are the properties that make the object what it is
       - Matter serves as the subject for form
     - Example: "a whit erock is hard and heavy, this is its form" and the matter serves as the subject to these properties
     - Matter and form are one
**** Aristotle and Change 
     - When an object undergoes change, its form changes while its matter remains
     - The three beings
       - Non-being, potential being, and being
	 - A seed is a potential tree
**** Attributes and Motives for Natural Change
     - Why should a seed move from being a seed to being a tree
**** Aristotle and his Four Causes
     - The four causes that are important to understanding change
       - Formal cause
	 - The form received by a thing
       - Material cause
	 - The matter underlying that form
       - Efficient cause
	 - The agency that brings about the chance
       - Final cause
**** Understanding the Four Causes
     - The construction of a statue to understand the four causes
       - Formal cause = the shape given by the marble
       - Material cause = the marble tha treceives the shape given to it
**** Aristotle and the Universe
     - The universe is full, there is no void/empty space
       - If there is void then density = zero and there is no valid ratio
       - Modern day we use resistance to describe this phenomena
     - Argues that the universe is eternal, he argues that there is no beginning in the universe
    - Four Elements
    - Earth, Fire, Water, Air
    - Motion in the Heavens
    - Each celestial sphere has its own prime mover
*** Class
    - Thing
      1. Knowledge begins with sense data
      2. through repetition moves to memory
      3. then through intuition/insight
      4. then ascend to universal principles
**** Plato's Forms
     - Absolute, ideal, immaterial, real
     - Independent existance, not everything has form (dirt)
     - World of appearances v. World of things as they are
     - 
     - forms are off in their own realm
       - The form, the form of a horse, a chair, the good
       - Everything has its own form

* Week 8
** Lindberg Aristotle (62-67)
   - Aristotle's greatest contribution was in descriptive zoology
     - More than 500 species of animals are mentioned in his History of Animals
   - Subdivided the human body
     - head
     - neck
     - thorax
     - arms
     - legs
   - External features
     - brain
     - digestive system
     - sexual organs
     - lungs
     - heart
     - blood vessels
   - Natural groupings of animals based on attributes
     - 2 major categories
       - Blooded (red-blooded)
	 - viviparous quadrupeds (four-fooded mammals that bring fourth living young)
	 - oviparous (egg-laying) quadrupeds
	 - marine mammals
	 - birds
	 - fish
	   - mollusks (octopus and cuttlefish)
	   - crustacea (crabs, crayfish)
	   - testacea (snail and oyster)
       - Bloodless
   - Aristotle was most comfortable with marine life, which he exhibited intimate firsthand knowledge
   - His description of the incubation of birds' eggs = excellent example of meticulous observation
   - form and matter, actuality and potentiality, the four causes, and the element of purpose or function associated with final cause are *central* to his biology
   - That which an organism is made is, of course, its *material cause*
   - agency by which it is made is its *formal or efficient cause* (which often merge in Aristotle's biology)
   - that which it becomes, the goal of its development, is its *final cause*
   - Aristotle identified form with soul and assigned it responsibility for the vital characteristics of living things
     - Plants posses nutritive soul (obtain nourishment, grow, reproduce)
     - Animals possess sensitive soul (sensation and (indirectly) movement)
     - Humans add to these a rational soul (higher capabilities of reason)
     - if soul is but the form of the organism, then it's not immortal because we disintegrate
   - Central question of aristotle's physiology: the problem of organic generation
   - Final cause in the context of biology is that which the biological organism is in the process of becoming
   - Aristotle made the heart the "central organ of the body, the seat of emotion and sensation as well as of vital heat."
   - displayed a healthy skepticism even about his own observations
   - not always skeptical enough, many examples of descriptive error in his biological works
   - Aristotle was one of the most brilliant biologists ever to live
** Aristotle's Biology Lecture
   - Biological work was similar to his work in other works
   - However, it was quite flexible, needed to leave room in his system for modifying
   - Outline
     - Interpretive caveats
     - Distinction from Linnaean taxonomy
     - Aristotle's /History of Animals/ and explanatory aims
     - Data collection using specialists, experimentation, and observation
     - Form and subform divisions (genos and eidos)
     - Teleological explanations about a thing's purpose and essence
   - History of Interpretation
     - Many dismissed his biological work as fanciful and perhaps silly - not without cause - certainly he was often remiss in experimentation
       - Thought that women had fewer teeth than men...
       - Brain was bloodless
       - Confusing beliefs about the salamander
     - Confusions about authorship and coherence of Aristotle's beliefs in regards to the rest of his philosophy
       - Some passages that clearly contradict each other
	 - Understandable perhaps reading in chronological order
   - History of Animals
     - Feels very empirical, and was likely composed from his years observing nature on the Isle of Lesbos, and the Mediterranean environments beyond Athens
     - many observations/reported data were quite insightful
     - Supplemented his own research with stories from experts (horse-breeders, shepherds, fishermen, beekeepers etc.), sometimes dismissed, and sometimes taken on faith
   - Biology required
     1) more sophisticated and flexible classifications than in Physics
     2) what he saw as more comprehensive *teleological* explanations rather than a reductive account of the elements (earth, fire, air, water) involved.
   - Form Divisions
     - knowledge of form is essential to proper classification, as is a knowledge of how forms interact
     - Plato thought forms were just combined in an unstructured way
     - Aristotle believed forms were *hierarchical* such that given forms could be divided into subforms
       - Footed ->
	 - genos
	 - bipedal
	 - eidos
     - Genos is a *RELATIVE* term
     - these are fungible structuring devices
   - Aristotelian Explanation -- Teleology *EXAMPLES*
     - Aristotle thought the purpose of the lungs was to regulate the animal's temperature. Why is it that fish do not have lungs? They do not need them as they are cooled by the surrounding water. What about dolphins? They are an in-between case, demonstrating that the concept of cooling needs more analysis
     - An epiglottis prevents the flow of liquid/food into the larynx. Animals that have lungs and skin also have an epiglottis, whereas those that are scaly or feathered do no. Why? They also have dry skin--which means they take in less liquid and so do not need an epiglottis
     - Fissipeds (carnivorous mammels with seperate toes) have /no/ horns, but they have claws and teeth, which serves as their defense instead of horns. Beacuse these horned animals have no sharp teeth, they need more stomachs to aid digestion...A camel, however, has no sharp teeth and more stomachs (for eating tough veg), but no horns, so gets /its/ defense from its great size.

    - The Chick and the Embryo
      - Aristotle was able to describe how a chick came into being
      - Aristotle opened fertilized eggs thought the development of the embryo
    - Two types of Explanations
      - Material
	- Material theory suspproted by empirical observations
	- Relate to knowledge
      - Teleological
	- Formal cause: essence, blueprint of something
	- Final case: the purpose of something
    - The Four Elements
      - Aristotle based his hierarchy based on his 4 elements:
	- Fire, Hot and Dry (Highest)
	- Air, Hot and Wet
	- Water, Cold and Wet
	- Earth, Cold and Dry (Lowest)
      - Genos and Eidos (RELATIVE)
	- Aristotle believed that there is a hierarchy of forms
	  - Genos: a given form
	  - Eidos: a sub-form
	- Animals (Genos)
	  - Footless (Eidos)
	  - Foot (Eidos)
	- Foot (Now a Genos)

      - (A or not-A)
    - 
** On Generation
   - Early biology was interested in generation
   - Anaximander
     - while disliking uncaused-causes, noticed that, compared to animals, humans took longer to rear and that children could not find food for themselves
     - concluded that humans must have originally originated from another species that could find food for itself and be completely self-sufficient from a young age
     - 'Primitive' animals appeared from the moisture evaporated by the heat of the sun...and human fetuses resemble fish...so...
     - Narrative: Animals protected by a scaly skin but by colonising the land, their skin split and they adapt to the environment. Fish appeared first and gave rise to humanity through this process of *evolutionary change*
   - Aristotle & Theophrastus
     - Theophrastus, the botanist
     - /History of Animals/ by Aristotle
       - looked at physiology of animals
       - comparing and contrasting organs and their specific functions
       - some organs varied in different animals
   - Reproduction
     - was mysterious
     - one prominent way to classify: 'mode of birth'
     - Viviparous: producing live young
     - Oviparous: producing young in eggs that hatch outside the body of the parent
     - Vermiparous: producing worms or grubs (spontaneously?)
   - Development
     - How is it that young look like their parents (from the structure of their limbs to the shape of their nose)?
     - Pangenesis: material (and form) for generating offspring come from all areas of the parent
     - Preformation: The embryo is a fully preformed person--a miniature--that only expands in magnitude and exists within the first person like infinitely nested russion dolls. (static)
     - Epigenesis: organisms develop in /stages/ with some parts developing before others (e.g. the heart before the eyes). [Chick experiment]
     :Stages_boy-man:
     "Either all the parts...come into being together or in succession...That the former is not the fact is plain...for some of the parts are clearly visible as already existing in the embryo while others are not; that it is not because of their being too small that they are not visible is clear, for the lung is of greater size than the heart, and yet appears later than the heart"...stages as a boy to a man
     :END:
   - Matter & Form
     - Women provide the matter for the baby, men provide the form/soul (actual and various potential stages). The semen is a driving force of sorts for the development. A neat explanatory package.
     - Primary role of the heart
     - Connection with his physics

     - Pierce; "you have to know the person better in order to diagnose them"
     - Noah: "the specifics of the person and their I guess what we would call "medical history" to determine how best to treat them"
   - Outline
     1. Naturalisation of Disease
	- You're not just angering the gods, it can be naturalistically explained
	- Epilepsy ('sacred disease'). Report criticises divine responsibility and charlatans that use it for their
	- Select characteristics can be blamed (e.g. being plegmatic)
	- /Prognostic/: great attention to detail (e.g. the eyes) in examinations
	- /Epidemics/: conditions (e.g. climate) for outbreak of disease and 'critical days' in the development
	- Do all diseases have a single origin? Are they varied by body type? Are diseases always different? What is the cause?
     2. Hippocrates (background)
	- Critical points
	  1. Had scarlet fever, 3 days when the fever breaks; if it does break, 99% possibility of living, if not, 99% death
	- c. 460 BCE - c. 370 BCE
	- clear and concise in his writings...
	- Seen as one who first freed medicine from superstition, magic, and the supernatural
	  - That is, disease is a natural process! We do not need to appease the gods.
	- Emphasised diet, exercise and strengthening the patient, over the elimination of disease. passive approach
	- The body needed to be treated holistically, as a unified organism

*** Presentation by Tatiana Streidl - Galen
    - Contributions to medicine
      - He helped develop and finalize ideas that had been brought about by Hippocrates
      - One of the first to realize the importance of exercise
      - Helped publish incredible amounts of medical documents for his time
	- Published 5 times what Plato did
	- 22 thousand pages worth of information in a lifetime
      - Was the father of pathology
      - One of the most influential supporters of bloodletting
      - Helped bring awareness to the importance of the lungs and brain
    - Bloodletting
      - Bloodletting went on without a hitch for nearly 2,000 years. Do you think that, given the time period and research that had been done through that time, that it was reasonable for it to not have been stopped earlier?
      - You drain "bad" blood in order to let you recover
      - Viruses behave very differently than the bacteria
    - The Brain
      - Aristotle thought that the heart was the seat of reason in a person
      - Tied and cut nerves to find that it all went back to the brain
    - Galen's Anatomy
      #+CAPTION: Anatomy of the Heart
      [[file:./Week 9/galensanatomy_100637.png]]
      - The spine controls our body from top to bottom
      - Spine relates to the organ functions
      - Related human's anatomy to animals, analogies
	- Was off because we don't exactly match them
	- Was unable to dissect humans as it was taboo for the time
    - Contributions to philosophy
      - Mechanism: the doctrine that all natural phenomena, including life and thought, allow mechanical explanation by physics and chemistry
      - Vitalism: a doctrine that the processes of life are not explicable by the laws of physics and chemistry alone and that life is in some part self-determining
      - did not believe in atomism and mechanism
      - believed that the body was functioning as a few large units and vitalism
      - Explained the way the body works by saying "cause God made it that way"
    - Questions
      - Do you think it was completely reasonable for Galen to completely reject atomism the way he did?
      - Do you agree with Galen that it is necessary to look at bodily functions from a vitalism point of view in contrast to a mechanist one?
    - Galen's thing is not very mechanistic, it's very connected to teleology
      - Why does the food go to the stomach?
	- The stomach has an attractive power
	  - Same way that electrons are attracted to protons

* Week 10
** Lloyd Ch. 7 - Fourth-Century Astronomy
   - Earlier history of astronomy
     - Greek attempts to construct a mechanical model for the heavenly bodies go back to *Anaximander*
     - Represented the stars as below the sun and moon indicates the primitive nature of his syste
     - rings of the sun, moon, and stars are spaced at regular intervals
     - Earth is three times as broad as it is deep
       - No basis in observation
     - Ignored the distinction between fixed stars and planets
   - First such mathematical account of the movements of the heavenly bodies belongs to Eudoxus of Cnidus
     - younger contemporary of Plato
       - associate of his at the Academy
   - The spindle of necessity
     - Speeds with which the circles move very
       - eight circle (moon) is the fastest
       - 7th - sun
       - 6th - Venus
       - fifth- Mercury
   - Passages in Plato are the earliest extensive Greek astronomical texts
     - Contain two important doctrines
       1. distinguished between two kinds of movement
	  1. the movement of the sphere of the fixed stars which is shared by all heavenly bodies
	  2. the independent movements of the sun, moon, and plants along the oblique circle of the ecliptic in an opposite sense to that of movement
       2. recognized that Venus and Mercury move with the same mean speed-that is, angular velocity-as the sun
	  - the two lowest planets are never far from the sun, and all three complete a revolution of the zodiac in (approximately) one year
   - Plato expressed what astronomers should aim at
     - recommends an ideal or mathematical astronomy in place of an observational one
     - Knows this is not usually how people do astronomy
   - Explanation of the observed movements of the planets was a chief issue in astronomy until Newton
   - Plato's contribution was insisting that astronomy is an exact, mathematical science
   - Main phenomena of an observer on earth
     1. all the heavenly bodies circle the earth from east to west
	- the effect of the earth's daily rotation about its axis
     2. different constellations are visible from a given point at different seasons in the year
	- bu the same constellations appear in approximately the same places at the same seasons in successive years
     3. the sun's position in relation to the stars changes regularly
	- it moves from west to east through a band of constellations, completing a single revolution in about a year
	- the paths of the moon and the visible planets do not deviate by more than eight degrees from the course of the sun itself
	  - the great circle known as the ecliptic
	- period taken to complete a single revolution of the zodiac varies
     4. moon and each of the planets also move from west to east through the constellations
     5. When a planet's position is tracked over a number of months, the irregularities known as the stations and retrogradations soon become apparent
   - Eudoxus' solution
     - the complex apparent paths of the sun, moon, and planets were, in each case, produced by the simple circular movements of a certain number of concentric spheres
     - earth is at rest
       - common centre of all the spheres
     - axes are inclined to one another
     - rotate at different thoguh uniform speeds
     - Postulated four such spheres for the five known planets
       1) the first or outermost sphere
	  - accounted for the phenomena caused by the daily rotation of the earth
	  - poles of this sphere lie on the north-south axis and rotates from east to west
	    - one revolution per 24 hrs
       2) the second sphere
	  - produced the apparent movement of the planet along with _the zodiac_
	  - axis of this sphere is perpendicular to the plane of the ecliptic
	  - rotates from west to east, but the speed with which it does so differs per planet
	  - his estimates of the periods of zodiacal revolution of each of the five planets are given in round figures by Siplicius
	    - correspond closely to the modern values quoted by Health
       3) the third and fourth spheres (the lowest spheres)
	  - used to explain the planet's stations and retrogradations
	  - third sphere
	    - poles lie on the circle of the eclpitic
	  - fourth sphere
	    - axis of the fourth sphere is inclied to that of the third at an angle that varies from planet to planet
	  - rotate at equal speeds but opposite directions, combined movement produces the curve that eudoxus named the "hippopede" or horse-fetter
	    - 8-shaped curve
	    - intersection of a sphere with a cylander touching it internally at a double point (Diagram 7, page 88)
     - Sun and moon
     - his system accounted fairly successfully for a wide variety of phenomena without breaking plato's rule that only simple circular movements should be postulated
     - theory sometimes failed
       1) each hippopede always produced exactly the same curve: but observed retrogradations were not always so
	  - shape, size, duration changes
       2) his figures provide basis for tolerable solution to the observed retrogradations of Saturan and Jupiter but not Mars and Venus
       3) the system failed to account for the inequality of the seasons, even though this was certainly known to Euctemon some time before Eudoxus
       4) failed to explain variations in the apparent diameter of the moon and in the brightness of the planets
	  - Later discovered that it was due to the fact that their distances vary
   - Eudoxus' predecessors tried to modify his work to allow for some of the phenomena that he couldn't explain
     - Callippus of Cyzicus, first such modification
       - Eudoxus postulated a total of twenty-seven spheres, Callippus increased by seven
   - Aristotle believed that for movement to take place, the spheres had to be in contact with one another
   - Eudoxus' spheres are conceived as connected through a mechanical system
   - chief importance of the fourth-century astronomy lies
     - *not* in the advance in observational methods nor in the collection of empirical data
     - in the successful application of mathematical methods to the study of complex natural phenomena
   - a now common notion: /some geometric model/ would provide the solution to the problem of celestial motion
     - pushing the idea that _the the world as a whole is the product of rational design_
** Kepler's New Astronomy: Basics of Observation
   - simplest explanation: Surrounded by a sphere of stars
   - moon phases
     - the moon doesn't keep up with the stars
   - the month, moon phases
   - Sun moves against the stars on a particular path over many months
   - 12 constellations (or signs) of the zodiac, the constellations along the sun's path
   - 1st day of spring, the first star of ares
   - 26 thousand year cycle of the spring equinox, right now we're one zodiac off
   - First motion
     - stars all moving one way
   - Second motion
     - The motion of the moon going backwards against the stars over days
   - Mars is the wandering star, moves every day bit by bit
   - Mars loops, the odd diagram shown in Lloyd

       - NASA/Caltech's Jet Propulsion Laboratories have used these for science today
     - Halley's Comet
     - Jupiter's twelve-year orbit was associated with the zodiacs, hence the zodiacs we have today
   - Oldest map of the stars
     - 600 - 800 AD
     - 1500 stars
   - /gnomon/ : an object (a post stuck in the ground) whose shadow was used to record the changing position of the Sun
     - earliest record 7th century BC
     - most remarkable gnomon ever built was by Guo Shou jing at Gao cheng zhen 1279 AD
   - "astronomy stations" built by I Hsing, a Chinese monk

	  - Government in charge of Astronomy
	- Heaven affects earth
	  - Need to be able to predict astronomical events and understand how they influence humans
      - Star charts and calendars
	- Oldest known star chart
	  - Between 600 and 800 AD
	  - More than 1500 stars

      - Instruments
	- Gnomon: used for recording position of sun
	- Armillary spheres for determining positions of stars
      - Cosmological theories
	- Kai/Gai Tian
	  - heavens are a hemisphere over a square earth
	- Hun Tian
	  - Stars pass around equator
	    - Earth a sphere
	    - Stars on a sphere
	  - Not really a theory
	- Xuan Ye
	  - Sun, moon, stars made of unknown material, float in infinite empty space
	- Area around pole was most important for all theories
      - Didn't try to model motions of plants
	- Why? Their astronomy:
	  - Was more practical
	    - So there was less "causal speculation"
	  - Was more focused on poles
	  - Had no Euclidean Geometry!
    - Early Islamic Astronomy
      - General accomplishments
	- Developed sophisticated mathematical and trigonometric techniques including sines and cosines
	- Developed sophisticated astronomical instruments
	- Believed in empirical observation and measurement
	  - Accurately measured length of year and tilt of Earth's axis
	  - Discovered Andromeda galaxy and Magellanic Clouds
	- Improved on and corrected mistakes of Ptolemy
	  - Precisely measured and predicted timing and position of moon (their calendar was based on lunar cycle)
      - Motivation
	- Again, fairly practical
	  - Used stars to navigate the deserts
	  - Their astronomy was focused on "making prayer easier"
	    - Needed to know direction of Mecca and exact time of day to pray (five times per day)
	    - Islamic calendar based on lunar cycle
	  - Also likely wanted to "show the perfection of God's universe"
	  - Houses of learning
	    - Mixing ideas from all over the world
	    - All different religions and cultures

	- Built mechanical clock to measure time to the hour, and then to the second
      - Theories
	- Separated science and religion
	  - Did not believe in idea of using the stars and planets for predicting the future
	- Stressed empirical observation and measurement
	  - Unlike Greeks, who believed they could discover truths with their minds alone
	  - This new mindset sped up progress
	- Continued and improved Ptolemy
	  - Kept Greek beliefs in that heavens could be explained mathematically
	  - Found and fixed Ptolemy's errors
	  - Stuck with geocentricism
    - Questions
      - Why did the ancient philosophers/scientists apply mathematical models to the sky and not to other aspects of reality?
	- Why didn't the Chinese model the sky?
      - How did the practicality or secularity of astronomy affect its development? Its flexibility? Its approaches?
	- Because it was practical, it drove them to find how it works. However, it didn't necessarily drive them to keep asking the question of "Why" everything happened the way it did. If it did, then it was more out of curiousity than out of practicality
      - What is the point of recording positions of all stars?
      - How well did the ancient astronomers balance their reliance on data and on assumptions?
      - Were they really falsifiable about perfection of heavens?
	- What does perfection of the heavens mean?
	- 
** DeWitt Ch 12
   - The motion of heavenly bodies
     - Everything points to the opposite of Newton's law
   - Things *want* to emulate some sense of perfection
     - Thus, the heavenly bodies *want* have the desire of the gods and thus move in perfect circles
** Kepler's New Astronomy: Ptolemy's System
   - We don't feel the earth move
   - Ptolemy didn't think the earth could be spinning
     - If you jumped, then it would spin under you
   - To explain mars
     - Different circles of motions
       1. deferent
       2. epicycle on the deferent circle
   - Only gave ratios between the orbits and epicycles of each planets
   - His only job was to "save appearences"
   - Newton thought this was insane and that it was like a cook roating the whole kitchen around a roast
** Kepler's New Astronomy: Ptolemy's Equant
   - made adjustuments to deferent off of the earth so that angles would make sense in the speed changes
   - Apparent location: Seen from earth
   - Center of distances: Center
   - Center of motion: Equant
   - Don't forget: everything spins around the earth every day
** W11D2
*** *Ava Giles* Presentation
    - Key Concepts of Pre-1600 Astronomical Theory
      - Mostly Aristotle's ideas
      - Perfect Circle fact: all heavenly bodies move in perfect circles
      - Uniform motion fact: the motion of all heavenly bodies is uniform, meaning the planets always move at the same rate, and never stop moving
    - The problems with Aristotle' model of the universe
      - Couldn't explain
	- Retrograde motion, when a planet eems to slow down and reverse its motion before resuming its course
	- Differences in brightness of planets
    - Pre-1600 Ideas about Motion
      - Remember, Newton's principle of intertia wasn't around yet, people's beliefs based on what they observed
      - Object in motion will stop unless something keeps it going
      - fits aristotle's worldview, objects tend to move toward their "natural" place in the universe
    - What about continuous uniform motion
      - What keeps them going?
      - Desire: Aristotelian gods, not religious ones
    - Earth is stationary
    - Ptolemy
      - Greek astronomer
      - Lived A.D. 100 - A.D. 178
      - Worked in Alexandria, Egypt
      - Relied heavily on observations about motions of th esun, moon, and planets made by the astronomer Hipparchus
    - Ptolemaic System
      - Geocentricity
      - Earth is spherical
      - Earth doesn't move
      - "Fixed stars" are fixed to a large sphere called the "heaven"
      - Accounts for *observed motions* by using two sets of circles
	- Deferent
	  - The larger circular orbit
	- Epicycle
	  - Smaller ciruclar orbit that reolves around the deferent
	- Solution explained the appeaance of retrograde motionw ithout proposing any change to the planets' organization or location relative to earth
    - More Adjustments
      - Eccentric
	- Similar to the Deferent, but its center is off-center that is, in a different location than Earth
	- This allowed Ptolemy to account for changes in a planet's brightness
      - The Equant
	- A point not coincident with Earth or with the eccentric
	- If a planet's epicycle is centered on the equant point, rather than the earth or the eccentric, this solves the problem of uniform motion. The planet's epicycle moves with uniform speed relative to the equant
    - Saving the phenomena
      - Ptolemy deviced his astronomical system to "save the phenomena"
      - 
*** QUESTIONS
    - What did he mean by the gods evolving to Christian and Judaic gods?
    - The difference between instrumentalism and realism in the context of space
      - Why realism may not be needed in heaven?
    - Society is hard to change,  they hold on to what's comfortable, the norm, and the default
    -

*** Notes
    - It was the lack of metaphysical leap from geocentric to heliocentric universe that prevented the Arabs from making more progress
    - China was more efficient in "applying human natural knowledge to practical human needs." (241)
    - superiority was wholly of a practical and technological nature, not of theoretical understanding
    - Science at its heart is systematic and theoretical knowledge about how the world is and how it works
      - always conjecturing existance of new entities, processes, mechanisms, new worlds
    - /episteme/ as opposed to /techne/
    - inventiveness of Chinese could be seen as a lack of freedom in an intellectual sense, not delving into the metaphysical realm
    - Chinese excelled in empirical observations rather
    - lagged behind in much everything else
    - Geometry as systematic deductive system of proofs and demonstrations were virtually nonexistent in China, along with trigonometry
    - Chinese did not realize that the geographic location changed astronomical calculations until 1447
      - Arab astronomers knew of the changes in location and calculated time accordingly
    - Chinese astronomers didn't accept other mathematical influence from Islam and Persia
      - more algebra-based point-estimation system rather than geometrical analysis
    - Chinese were greatly hampered by the lack of the Greek deductive geometry
      - Arabs inherited this geometry
    - "protest against asking why modern science did not emerge in China is ill-considered" meaning?
    - To disregard such inquiries as to why one social group or another, one society or civilization or another, did not follow a particular line, etc, leading to higher levels of scientific achievement and eceonomic performance, is little more than moral censure
      - harsh criticism
    - by 1644, Chinese mathematics and astronomy had merged with Europe
      - end of Ming dynasty
    - China's long history of herbal medicine is now combined with the one universal science of pharmaceuticals
    - "Chinese leaders have recognized that modern science and technology contain elements of indispensable truth well worth having"
    - Chinese education focused more on moral uprightness and historical figures rather than rudimentary things like mathematics and mundane scientific pursuits per se

*** Notes
    - Arabic an Islamic Developments - Noah Giles
    - Setting the scene for Islamic Science
      - Alexander the Great conquered Asia and North Africa (334-323 BC) and left behind Hellenistic ideas
      - Religion also playe da huge part in promoting not only learning, but also the exchanging of ideas especially in western Asia (Manicheism, Zoroastrianism, and Christianity were the big three religions in the region)
    - Arabia is in the middle of everywhere, centralized portion of the world
    - Chrisetians bring Greek ideas to Persia
      - Missionaries established monasteries as well as churches and persecuted Nestorian Christians coming from the byzantine Empire
    - Nestorian Christian Influence cont.
      - Translated it into Aramaic and Arabic
      - Not just about oral transmittion but also writing it down
      - Gondeshapur, a medicine city
	- religions scholars with ideas in medicine were integraded into Abbasid courts as physicians
    - Enter Islam
      - Prophet Muhammad was born in 570 A.D and started spreading Islam in the Arabian Peninsula with his successors eventually uniting the whole peninsula and expanding north into Persia and Byzantium
      - Didn't just expand the empire with religion, was a normal guy before this
      - Qur'an largely defined all aspects of Islamic life and was the method and means of education
    - Beginning of Islamic Hellenisation
      - Umayyads (from 641 to ~750 A.D.) set up in Damascus and used Syrians and Persians as secretaries
      - In 750 
    - Benefits of Empire
      - Abbasids united the whole Western Asia / Middle Eastern region and a large part of Africa under one empire which made exchanging of ideas across the region much easier
      - Further, paper from China made recording, translating, and sharing knowledge much more attainable
      - Having become a minority, the Abbasids wanted to make the transition of rule go smoothly so they emulated Persian rulers in terms of scientific stance
    - Islamic Science
      - based around building off of and refining Greek ideas
      - Key method of transmitting and recording knowledge was through books
      - Al-Kwarizmi analysed Indian math and Euclidian geometry to create a refind number system and Algebra. Trigonometry was an extension of Ptolemy's Almagest and the Indian Siddhanta
      - All of these advanced astronomy and in turn were advanced by astronomy
    - Peer Review and Continued Extrapolation
      - Caliph Al-Ma'mun (786-833 A.D.)
    - Islamic Science
      - Optics
    - Optics
      - Rainbows
	- Ibn Sina, relfection of solar light by individual droplets of moisture that make up a cloud
	- Kamal al-Din
	  - First rainbow was made from reflection and refraction, second rainbow made through two internal reflections
    - Medicine
      - Pre-Islamic medicine, prophetic medicine, bloodletting etc
      - Actual hospitals (institutions) oculists, bonesetters, and surgeons; starting to spring up in Baghdad
	- 800 A.D.
    - Qur'an goes against atomism
      - led to a separation of religion and science?
    - Organized body of medical work
    - /Cannon of Medicine/ by Ibn Sina
      - five headings
	1) generalities
	2) herbal and non herbal remidies
	3) diseases head to toe
	4) dieases not specific to one part of the body
	5) compound drugs
      - Ib al-Nafis (1213-1288 AD) discovered pulmonary transit of blood
    - Larger Significance
      - The Islamic world developed dedicated institutions, made science more accessible through translation, and expanded the role of specialists
      - Cultural mixing combined with the rise of patrons allowed for different ideas to exist on thesame point and further encouraged the exchange / refinement of those ideas
      - The Islamic world gathered and organized seperate scientific thought into one uniform whole, which allowed for a more comprehensive in depth study of the material

      - /corpus juris civilis/
    - 12th and 13th centuries that universities arose in Europe
      - neutral zones of intellectual autonomy

    - New intellectual agenda was thoroughly naturalistic
      - scientific core of readings and lectures
      - core of evolutionary course of study
    - questions of existance, vacuums
    - No established zones for public forums in China
    - no legally autonomous universities
    - Freedom of action, of contract, and of self-governance were all absent in China
    - Travel was more open and encouraged in the Middle East and Europe
    - Medical professionals could never gain positions of power in China

      - Was it realy science?
      - Were medieval and early modern science etc?
    - Anti-medieval positons
      - Francis Bacon (1561 - 1626): said that the ages between antiquity and the time in which he was living were "unprosperous" for the sciences
      - Voltair (1694-1778): "general decay and degeneracy"
      - Andrew Dickson White: Christianity is evil and it interfered with the development of natural sciences
    - Pro-Medieval Positions
      - Pierre Duhem (1861-1916): thought they were laying the foundation for modern science
    - Revolution
      - Lindberg: revolution "represents fundamental change, with no limits on elapsed time" (360)
      - potentially revolutionary for early modern science:
	- Physics and Math
	- Experimental method
    - Physics and Math
      - because Aristotle recognized difference between math and physics but did not allow for crossing between the two disciplines
	- *Not* necessarily true, did not support prohibiting the crossing off of the two disciplines
    - Experimental Method
      - Revolutionary for the early modern period
    - Things to say
      - Modern day ways of information exchange:
	- Github, community, internet
	  - Open source software
	    - better code; if there's interest in the project
	- options, people to interact with
	- education, and commnuities of people online

	- Growth of universities
	- Curriculum and (impressive) autonomy
      - Philosophy I
      - Philosophy II
      - Institutionalised
    - Middle Ages
      - Idea of Middle Ages from 14th-15th C Italian Humanists, covering *roughly* 500-1450 [500-1000 early, 1000-1200 high, 1200-1450 late]
      - Early M.A. was de-urbanised and Monasteries dominant educational force, focusing on religion, though some earlier work survived (Aristotle e.g.)
	- Boethius (applied Airstotelian logic to theology)
	- Isidore of Seville (used philosophical tradition as comparison for religion)
	- Gregory of Tours
	- Gregory the Great (phil. underpinnings)
	- Bede
    - Dissemination in Europe
      - Charlemagne 8th C burst of learning as empire grew and centralised.
	- Alcuin brought liberal arts and astronomy, raised education of clergy with mandate for education
      - John Scotus Eriugena (c860) trans. Greek texts and enhanced Neoplatonism
      - Gerbert (c.970s-1000), later Pope, travelled widely and disseminated learning, particualrly mathematical
      - Translation (boomed in early 12th C) developed through individuals and recoquests. Gerard of Cremona translated the /Almagest/ (c1140s) and huge numbers of others in all disciplines
    - Islamic World
      - [[file:./Week 14/islamicworldmap_214258.png]]
    - Islamic Advance
      - 'the scholar's ink is holier than the martyr's blood'
      - By the end of the 8th C.e., Islam had already assimilated most of the extant great works from Greece, AIran, and India. This assimilation was made possible through an extraordinary movement of translation, which has possibly no equivalent in history
      - Immediately following, In the 8th trhough the 10th centuries, early scientists like Al-Haytham, Jabir ibn Hayyan (Geber) and Abu Bakr al-Razi advanced a set of techniques, tools, and principles for controlled and precise experimentation--the proto scientific method!
      - Any study that improved the tasks of daily life was encouraged
	- medical knowledge
	- ways of measuring and calulating for maps
	  - buildings
	- tools for agriculture
	- general craft industries (papermaking)
	- relied on their own experiments more than on authorities
	- alchemical studies formed an important part of other industries such as metal-working, ceramics, pharmacy, and dyeing
      - Input, flood of texts
      - Withdrawal from the sciences (Al-Ghazali), religious division, and conquests heralded the end of this 'golden period' in the 13th C
	- Al-Ghazali
	  - reason leads to hell
	  - anything that quibbled with metaphysical ideas was frowned upon
    - Schools, Universities, and Approach
      - 11th and 12th C Schools, from
	1) stronger, ordering monarchies
	2) secure borders
	3) growing moey economy and trade
	4) technological improvements, particularly as concerns food production
	5) population explosion and re-urbanisation that concentrated money and interest in education
      - Clergy schools open to all for a fee and broke off (in curriculum and geography) as needed for the clientele (medicine, law, logic, maths). Regional foci--France attached to cathedrials but broad; Italy law and medicine; Britain theology and logic
      - Managerial revolution--reason can reform/address all
      - Reason applied to 'support and defend' religion. Anselm (c.1080s) ontological proof of God. Peter Abelard (c1120s) continued reason's challenge to dogma
      - Advanced from simply teh Trivium ("the three roads") of grammar, rhetoric and logic, to the Quadrivium ("the four roads") of arithmetic, geometry, music, and astronomy/cosmology
      - Centres grew in cities and attracted masters and pupils, which eventually called for organisation, securing rights, and protections akin to the merchant guild structure
	- Bizarrily democratic institution
    - "Philosophy - the 'invited guest' stays"
      - Emphasised philosophy, law, morality, logic, and Aristotle! in a fairly consistent curriculum with great freedom of study
      - Natural Philosophy 12th C - Plato's *\ /\Timaeus\/ \* key (until Aristotle in the 13thc), which advanced on ordered, law-bound divine cosmology. Needed to fit with bible -> Thierry of Chartres (c1150s) restricted divine intervention to first moment of creation. After that it is all natural causes
      - William of Conches (c1150s) followed this tradition and took it to English royalty: exhaust natural explanation before considering miracles. The complexity of natural processes only further supports divine power
      - Rise of humanism, studying humans and their powers in their own right. Macrocosm and microcosm mirror. Numerology and astrology also grew but as a distant side note.
    - Philosophy II
      - The pursuit of truth, became the *motto* of European universities and they claimed freedom on that ground. They were /mini democracies/ founded upon and justified by their merit and aims with legal protections and autonomy unlike any other such body
      - Coupled with the historical particularly of separation of church and state rule, the Christian conception of an absolute God, a god with unlimited powers enabled the broader and freer contemplation of alternatives, the nature of the universe, the mechanisms that made it work, etc.
    - Institutionalised
      - The universities "sprang into existence ...  without express authorization of king, pope, prince, or prelate. They were spontaneous products of that instinct of association which swept like a great wave over the towns of Europe in the eleventh and twelfth centuries" (H. Rashdall, 1936)
      - Lrgely through monumental efforts at translation and dissemination, by 1200 Europe had as astonishing collection of scientific texts that formed the heart of the nascent universities: Euclid's /Elements/, Ptolemy's /Almagest/, Ibn al-Haythem's /Optics/, the algebra of al-Khwarizmi, ritings of Glaen and Hippocrates, Ibs Sina's /Canon of Medicine/, and many works by Aristotle, including /Physics, On the Heavens, On Generation and Corruption, On the Soul, Metorology, The Small Works of Natural Things, The History of Animals, The Parts of Animals, and The Generation of Animals.../
      - Europeans had no issue with combining the craft of scholarly traditions, and used both methods in their endless conquests

*** Notes
    + *Dylan Chalcraft Presentation*
    + *Medieval (Meta)Physics and the Rise of Western Universities*
    + Context
      - Western Roman Empire falls, beginning of the so called "dark ages."
      - Christanity grows spreads and becomes the dominant religion in Europe
	- Source of identity
	- Sort of gives a moral compass
      - War and conflict inhibit widespread advances in philosophy outside of the church
      - Renaissance marks the end of the middle ages
    + Medieval (Meta)Physics
      - Heavily influenced by Aristotle's work, using Aristotle as a starting point
      - There is a resurgence of the explorations of Forms and Natures
      - Medieval Philosophers defined two types of form, Substantial and Accidental forms
    + Matter and Form
      - Ibn Sina (980-1037) and Ibn Rushd (1126-98) worked with the links between matter and form
      - They thought that the creation of the elements was not the simple two step process described by Aristotle. A third step was necessary
      - Corporeal Form, the third form, which must be applied to the matter to create a three dimensional body, which is then ready to receive its elemental form
    + Combinations
      - Central to the four elements theory is that all things are constituted of the four elements
      - Questioning of how these mixtures are aligned raise the possibility of prime movers, celestial forces, or even God creating these combinations that create new Substantial Forms
