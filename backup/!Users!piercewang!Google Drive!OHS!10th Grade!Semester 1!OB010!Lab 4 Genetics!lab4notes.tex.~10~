Genetics is a defining factor in how traits are passed down from generation to generation in all living organisms. A defining character in the field of genetics is Gregor Mendel who, through the breeding of pea plants, came up with the basis of all genetic research thereafter. Mendelian genetics works by having certain alleles that pass down the traits from generation to generation. These alleles describe the genes that the organism displays, phenotypes. The phenotypes are determined by the alleles through dominant and recessive alleles, the difference commonly shown as a capital letter vs the lowercase respectively. The organism commonly has two of these alleles which determine the phenotype. The two alleles could be either dominant or recessive. If both dominant, the organism is described as homozygous dominant as it has both dominant alleles. This is similar with both recessive as it is shown to be homozygous recessive. If the organism has a mix of dominant and recessive alleles, then it is said to be heterozygous. The following is an example of a punnet square with one trait where both parents are heterozygous.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|ll|}
\hline
 & A & a\\
\hline
A & AA & Aa\\
a & aA & aa\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Mendel also defined the law of segregation. The law of segregation was defined by mendel as the process during gameete formation in which a memnber of the allelic pair seperates from the other member to form the next gamete. When dealing with more than two traits, one can use a combination of punnet squares to create a table which represents a situation in which two more or traits are involved. In a situation with two traits, the table would represent a dihybrid cross. The following is an example of a punnet square with two traits: Aa and Bb where the one parent has AABb and the other is heterozygous for both traits (AaBb).

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|llll|}
\hline
 & AB & Ab & AB & Ab\\
\hline
AB & AABB & AAbB & AABB & AAbB\\
Ab & AaBb & AAbb & AABb & AAbb\\
aB & AaBB & AabB & AaBB & AabB\\
ab & AaBb & Aabb & AaBb & Aabb\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

At this point, Mendel defined the law of independent assortment which states that the individual traits of an organism do not affect each other.
