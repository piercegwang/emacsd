WHen you grow up, be a good father. Do what's best for your kids such that they might have a happy life and know God. Don't expect anything in return. Being a father is not about what your kids can in the end do for you, (like dad would say... "A thankless job") Of course it's nice to receive gratitude, but it's not something you should seek for gratitude's sake. Your job is to be there for your son in his times of need, build good memories.
