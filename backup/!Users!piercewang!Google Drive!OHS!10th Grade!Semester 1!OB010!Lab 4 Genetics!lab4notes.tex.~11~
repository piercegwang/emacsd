\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:orgf43eaed}

Genetics is a defining factor in how traits are passed down from generation to generation in all living organisms. A defining character in the field of genetics is Gregor Mendel who, through the breeding of pea plants, came up with the basis of all genetic research thereafter. Mendelian genetics works by having certain alleles that pass down the traits from generation to generation. These alleles describe the genes that the organism displays, phenotypes. The phenotypes are determined by the alleles through dominant and recessive alleles, the difference commonly shown as a capital letter vs the lowercase respectively. The organism commonly has two of these alleles which determine the phenotype. The two alleles could be either dominant or recessive. If both dominant, the organism is described as homozygous dominant as it has both dominant alleles. This is similar with both recessive as it is shown to be homozygous recessive. If the organism has a mix of dominant and recessive alleles, then it is said to be heterozygous. The following is an example of a punnet square with one trait where both parents are heterozygous.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|ll|}
\hline
 & A & a\\
\hline
A & AA & Aa\\
a & aA & aa\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Mendel also defined the law of segregation. The law of segregation was defined by mendel as the process during gameete formation in which a memnber of the allelic pair seperates from the other member to form the next gamete. When dealing with more than two traits, one can use a combination of punnet squares to create a table which represents a situation in which two more or traits are involved. In a situation with two traits, the table would represent a dihybrid cross. The following is an example of a punnet square with two traits: Aa and Bb where the one parent has AABb and the other is heterozygous for both traits (AaBb).

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|llll|}
\hline
 & AB & Ab & AB & Ab\\
\hline
AB & AABB & AAbB & AABB & AAbB\\
Ab & AaBb & AAbb & AABb & AAbb\\
aB & AaBB & AabB & AaBB & AabB\\
ab & AaBb & Aabb & AaBb & Aabb\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

At this point, Mendel defined the law of independent assortment which states that the individual traits of an organism do not affect each other. 

\section{Materials and methods}
\label{sec:orgf0e5fa0}

The experiments testing the validity of Mendelian genetics were achieved by using the materials and methods described in the \emph{Stanford OHS AP Biology Genetics Lab} protocol and began by preparing 4 petri dishes with a dampened filter paper. This filter paper was cut to the appropriate size for the petri dish and then wet with 15 drops of tap water from a pipette. Seeds were placed in appropriately labeled petri dishes and were then placed in 4 seperate plastic bags and under a flourescent light which was on at all times where they were observed over a 7 day period.

In order to view the difference in traits between the P1, P2, F1, and F2 generations (P1 and P2 being the parents, F1 being P1 and P2's offspring, and F2 the offspring of F1 self-fertalizing), the plants were observed and categorized by traits. The results were put into tables shown in results. In general, when taking observations every day, the filter paper was also checked and water was appropriately added to those petri dishes whose filter papers were not damp. In addition, much of the water evaporated and condensed along the sides of the petri dish. To rewater the plants, a pipette was dragged along the walls such as to allow all the water to fall down onto the filter paper and water the plants without adding excess water.

\section{Results}
\label{sec:org7a37893}

In order to observe Mendelian genetics in action over three generations, four petri dishes were set up to show the generation's different traits. The final results are shown in the table below and are presented according to the following legend:
\begin{enumerate}
\item purple stem and dark green leaf
\item purple stem and light green leaf
\item non-purple stem and dark green leaf
\item non-purple stem and light green leaf
\item Unidentifiable (Unsprouted)
\end{enumerate}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|r|r|r|r|r|}
\hline
 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5\\
\hline
P1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 11 & 0\\
P2 & 8 & 3 & 0 & 1 & 0\\
F1 & 9 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
F2 & 22 & 1 & 0 & 6 & 3\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
As seen from this table, the P1, P2, and F1 generations were quite uniform in terms of phenotype. My hypothesis, formed assuming that P1 and P2 were completely uniform, was that the P1 generation and P2 generations were homozygous dominant and recessive respectively. Thus, I would predict that the F1 generation would be completely heterozygous. Thus, the F2 generation is easily predicted using a punnet square:
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=.9\linewidth]{./data/punnetsquare.png}
\end{center}
The color in the above table corresponds to the phenotype that is expressed. P represents the color of the stem, and G represents the color of the leaf. My hypothesis was also that the dominant allele for P would represent a purple stem and the dominant G would represent a dark green leaf.

The plants that were tested started sprouting within three days. The following is a picture of the F2 generation on the third day of testing.

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:orgfb5767a}

The results of this experiment and the F2 generation did not exactly reflect the predicted table's ratios as the actual ratios observed were (according to the legend previously stated in results, 1:2:3:4) 22:1:0:6 when they were expected to be 9:3:3:1. This was actually quite odd because the 4th phenotype, non-purple stem and light green leaf, should have been the most rare. However, it turned out to be \textasciitilde{}20\% of the displayed phenotypes in the F2 generation. This could be accounted for by a mistake in one of the base assumptions in this experiment which was that the P1 and P2 generations were completely uniform. If one were to not assume this, then the P2 could have had some gametes that were heterozygous rather than being homozygous dominant. This, combined with the knowledge that the rest of P2 was not exatly uniform, according to the table of observations (refer to Results), explains the fact that F2 had more offspring that were homozygous recessive for both traits. 

I predicted that the F2 generation would have an approximate ratio of 9:3:3:1. However, this was not the case and my hypothesis was proved wrong. One possible reason for this was an error in observation. It was sometimes very hard to categorize the plants as having one phenotype or the other because of how difficult it was to tell the difference between dark green and light green. Thus, this could very well have introduced a significant amount of error into the experiment's results.

\section{Post-lab Questions}
\label{sec:orge236796}
\begin{itemize}
\item How do your results exemplify Mendelâ€™s Law of Segregation and the Law of Independent Assortment? If you have already addressed this in your discussion, you may refer to the specific page and paragraph as your answer.
\end{itemize}

My results show that the law of segregation is in effect because if it were no, then more than one allele would be passed on from each parent and thus once the plant gained on dominant allele, that allele and all the others would be passed on to the next generation and the dominant allele would always be expressed. The law of independent assortment is shown to be in effect because the traits do not visibly affect each other (the dark green leafed plants aren't always shown with purple stems). If the law of independent assortment were not in effect, then the traits would most likely be paired with a counterpart thus meaning that if one plant has one trait, it is likely to have another. For example, the purple stem trait could be linked with the dark green leaf trait.

\begin{itemize}
\item Perform a Chi-squared analysis on your data, and determine if your data support your hypothesis for F2. Remember, the formula for Chi-squared and the degrees of freedom are on the formula sheet!
\end{itemize}

SUM[(observed-expected)\(^{\text{2}}\)/(expected)]

Chi-squared = (22-16.3)\(^{\text{2}}\)/16.3 + (1-5.4)\(^{\text{2}}\)/5.4 + (0-5.4)\(^{\text{2}}\)/5.4 + (6-1.8)\(^{\text{2}}\)/1.8
D.F. Critical Value = 7.82
Chi-squared is greater than Critical value, therefore null hypothesis is rejected and the data is regarded as evidence against my hypothesis.
